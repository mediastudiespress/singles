Larry story: THE thing that killed it was this time there was a big dinner at the Annenberg School. Seldes was still Dean. Seldes like to drink and was pretty well crocked by the time dinner started. Annenberg’s family (numerous sisters and his fuckin MOTHER, who was no youngster) were there. Seldes gives a toast where, in front of everyone, he says something like “America is a place where even the son of a gambler and bootlegger [here he looks to Walter] can create all of this!” This went over like a turd in the punchbowl. Walter’s mother turned to one of her daughters and said (in Yiddish, I think) “what did he say?” After this Annenberg wanted Seldes fired.
