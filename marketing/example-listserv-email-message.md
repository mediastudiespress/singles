Subject: New Open Access Book: Erving Goffman’s 1953 dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community

[mediastudies.press](https://www.mediastudies.press/) is a scholar-led, nonprofit, no-fee open access publisher in the media, film, and communication studies fields. We are excited to announce the publication of Erving Goffman’s remarkable 1953 dissertation, _[Communication Conduct in an Island Community](https://www.mediastudies.press/communication-conduct-in-an-island-community)_.

Canadian-born Erving Goffman (1922–1982) was the twentieth century’s most important sociologist writing in English. His 1953 [dissertation](https://www.mediastudies.press/communication-conduct-in-an-island-community) is published here for the first time, on the hundredth anniversary of his birth. The study, based on fieldwork on a remote Scottish island, presents in embryonic form the full spread of Goffman’s thought. Framed as a “report on a study of conversational interaction,” the dissertation lingers on the modest talk of island “crofters.” It is trademark Goffman: ambitious, unconventional in form, and brimmed with big-picture insight. The thesis is that social order is made and re-made in communication—the “interaction order” he re-visited in a famous and final talk before his 1982 death. The dissertation is, as Yves Winkin writes in a [new introduction](https://www.mediastudies.press/pub/yves-introduction?readingCollection=baaa50af), the “Rosetta stone for his entire work.” It was here, in 360 dense pages, that Goffman revealed, quietly, his peerless sensitivity to the invisible wireframes of everyday life.
