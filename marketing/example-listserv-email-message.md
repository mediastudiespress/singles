Subject: New Open Access Book: What Was Artificial Intelligence?

[mediastudies.press](https://www.mediastudies.press) is a scholar-led, nonprofit, no-fee open access publisher in the media, film, and communication studies fields. We are excited to announce the publication of our latest book, Sue Curry Jansen’s [*What Was Artificial Intelligence?*](https://www.mediastudies.press/wwai). 

When it was originally published in 2002, Sue Curry Jansen’s “What Was Artificial Intelligence?” attracted little notice. The long essay was published as a chapter in Jansen’s *Critical Communication Theory*, a book whose wisdom and erudition failed to register across the many fields it addressed. One explanation for the neglect, ironic and telling, is that Jansen’s sheer scope as an intellectual had few competent readers in the communication studies discipline into which she published the book. “What Was Artificial Intelligence?” was buried treasure. In this [mediastudies.press edition](https://www.mediastudies.press/wwai), Jansen’s prescient autopsy of AI self-selling—the rhetoric of the masculinist sublime—is reprinted with a new introduction. Now an open access book, [*What Was Artificial Intelligence?*](https://www.mediastudies.press/wwai) is a message in a bottle, addressed to Musk, Bezos, and the latest generation of AI myth-makers.

The book is available online, and as a free download in [PDF](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/singles/releases/download/wwai1.0/jansen-what-was-artificial-intelligence-2022.pdf), [ePub](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/singles/releases/download/wwai1.0/jansen-what-was-artificial-intelligence-2022.epub), and [Mobi](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/singles/releases/download/wwai1.0/jansen-what-was-artificial-intelligence-2022.mobi). The book is also available as a $5 [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1951399064?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860).
