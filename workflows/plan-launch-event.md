## Invitation email

Dear {{first-name}},

I hope that this note find you well! I am writing to invite you to join two or three other scholars for a brief (1 hour) Zoom discussion centered on the *{{title}}*—an open access collection that {{author}} recently published:

{{url}}

The idea is for a pair of scholars to join {{author-last-name}}, and me for an informal conversation about {{title}}. What we have in mind is about 5 minutes of introductory remarks from each of the guests (including {{author-last-name}}), followed by a moderated Q&A + conversation among the discussants. We would be thrilled to have your participation!

The little press that David Park and I run, mediastudies.press (open access and nonprofit), published the book late last year. 

We are aiming to hold the event on Friday {{date}}, {{time}} EST, though we may be able to accommodate other times that day (or even select another day).

Please let me know if this sounds like something you would be willing to join.

Thanks, Jeff

***
