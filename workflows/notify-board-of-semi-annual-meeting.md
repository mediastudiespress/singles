Dear mediastudies.press Board members,

Happy new year! And welcome to our two new board members, Juliette de Maeyer and Cheryll Soriano!

We are writing to (1) share the 2023 annual report and to (2) share a when2meet to identify a time for our Board meeting.

Here’s the annual report:

https://msp-docs.org/annual-reports/2023+Annual+Report

As for the meeting, we’re aiming for the week of February 19, but if we can’t find a time that works for all, we can try the next week too. Here’s the when2meet link:

We will plan to circulate an agenda and a few additional items at least a week before the meeting.

Thanks so much for your service on the Board!

Jeff and Dave
