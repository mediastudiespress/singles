# Create marketing plan on PubPub

#single #marketing

- [ ] Create a new Pub, titled ‘[author] Marketing,’ and assign it to the Internal collection
- [ ] Copy the headers below as rich text, and paste into the Pub
- [ ] If you haven’t already, order author copies for the author
- [ ] Now or at another time, retrieve the *Publicize new single on listservs* workflow
- [ ] Brainstorm emails to individuals and clusters of individuals who might be especially interested in the event
- [ ] Create a thread for Twitter and Mastodon, based on the long description
- [ ] Brainstorm journals and other publications for potential book reviewers; it may make sense to create a table, with the review editor, date tracking, etc. 
- [ ] Consider a launch event over Zoom
