CHAPTER 24
==========

*ALL FOR PURITY*
----------------

THERE are no interested, profit-motivated lobbyists at Washington; only
patriots, crusaders, guardians of our most sacred institutions, saviors
of humanity. If you doubt this, read the transcript of the public
hearings held December 7 and 8 in Washington on the Tugwell-Copeland
Food and Drug Bill. If, after that, you are still cynical, you should
read the mail the President, General Johnson, and Postmaster Farley
received from the patriotic medicine men, vitamin men, and cosmeticians
whose sole concern appeared to be the welfare of the present
Administration and the NRA. The names of these correspondents cannot be
divulged, but here are a few samples of their style:

> With yourself and every other loyal citizen of the United States
> endeavoring to assist in the relief of unemployment, it would seem
> that any type of legislation that would retard the recovery of
> business would be unfortunate at this time. Therefore, House Bill 6 no
> and the Copeland Bill should be given serious consideration as their
> effect upon an enterprise with an annual output of over $2,000,000
> would be serious indeed....
>
> We have no objections to regulation but ...here is no ordinary
> regulator measure of the industry. Here is a bill known as the Tugwell
> Bill...that openly demands that the Secretary of Agriculture in
> enforcement of regulations be final and absolute and without appeal to
> the courts....Now I’m no disgruntled manufacturer writing you; I’m
> quite well able to take care of myself and have been doing it in this
> business for many, many years....
>
> Practically all the worth-while factors in proprietary cosmetic, drug,
> food, and advertising industries are in accord that these Tugwell
> measures are impossible of amendment and should be withdrawn....
>
> I have recently been impressed with the danger to the Administration
> that is resulting from the agitation created by what is known as the
> Tugwell Bill....

There are four main points to note about this huge correspondence, of
which only a few typical examples have been excerpted: (1) that the
names of most of the ready letterwriter firms are already familiar
through notices of judgment issued by trie Food and Drug Administration
at the termination of cases brought under the present inadequate law, in
Post Office fraud orders or in the Federal Trade Commission
cease-and-desist orders; (2) that the writers invoke the principle of
“recovery” as opposed to “reform” in order to defend businesses which in
most cases are demonstrably a danger and a burden to both the public
health and the public pocketbook; (3) that they do not hesitate to
misrepresent both the nature and effects of the bill, as for example by
asserting that Administration action would not be subject to court
review although such review would be easily available to defendants
under both the original bill and the present revised Copeland Bill; (4)
that the writers, by implication, threaten the Administration with a
political headache and political defeat, regardless of the merit of the
issues involved.

The nature and methods of this lobby can best be understood by examining
the following “Who’s Who” of the leading lobbyists. A complete list is
as impossible, as would be any attempt to estimate the expenditure,
undoubtedly huge, of the proprietary drug, food, and advertising lobby.

*Frank (Cascarets) Blair*. Mr. Blair represents the Proprietary
Association, the chief fraternal order of the patent-medicine group, but
even closer to his heart, one suspects, is Sterling Products. This is a
holding company for the manufacturers of such products as Fletcher’s
Castoria, Midol, CaldwelPs Syrup and Pepsin, and Cascarets, a
chocolate-covered trade phenopthalein and cascara laxative recently
seized by the Food and Drug Administration. The Proprietary Association
and Mr. Blair, plus the National Drug Conference, backed the Black Bill,
written by Dr. James H. Beal, chairman of the board of trustees of the
United States Pharmacopoeia. The Black-Beal Bill would further weaken
even the present inadequate law, make seizures practically impossible,
and permit nostrum -makers to get away with murder in their advertising.
In short, it is a sheer fake.

*Hon. Thomas B. (Crazy Crystals) Love*. Mr. Love, a former Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, is attorney for the Crazy Water Company of
Mineral Wells, Texas, manufacturers of Crazy Crystals, a prominent
exhibit last summer in the Food and Drug Administration’s well-known
“Chamber of Horrors.” At the December hearings Mr. Love said, “No harm
has ever resulted, or is likely to result, from the misrepresentation of
the remedial or therapeutic effect of naturally produced mineral
waters,” which is a brazen enough falsification. Two kinds of harm
result from such misrepresentation—harm to the health of the victim who
takes a dose of horse physic under the illusion that a dose of salts is
good for what ails him; harm to the victim’s pocket-book because he paid
about five times as much for that dose of salts as it was worth.

*H. M. (Ovaltine) Blackett*. Mr. Blackett is president of
Blackett-Sample-Hummert, a Chicago advertising agency. His pet account
is Ovaltine, that mysterious “Swiss” drink which puts you to “sleep
without drugs” and performs many miracles with underweight children,
nursing mothers, busy workers and old people. “Food and drug
advertising,” Mr. Blackett writes to magazine and newspaper publishers,
“is different from other classifications. It must actually sell the
product. It must put up a strong selling story—strong enough to actually
move the goods off the dealers’ shelves.” More briefly, Mr. Blackett
believes it would be impossible to sell a “chocolate-flavored, dried
malt extract containing a small quantity of dried milk and egg” for what
it really is—at least for a dollar a can.

*William P. (Jacob’s Ladder) Jacobs*. Mr. Jacobs is president of Jacobs’
Religious List, which would appear to represent the alliance of the
fundamentalist business and the proprietarymedicine business. As a
publishers\* representative of the “official organs of the leading white
denominations of the South and Southeast,” he offers a combined weekly
circulation of 300,317 to the God-fearing manufacturers of Miller’s
Snake Oil (makes rheumatic sufferers jump out of bed and run back to
work), kidney medicines, rejuvenators (“Would you like to again enjoy
life?”), contraceptives (presumably for an equally holy purpose) ,
reducing agents and hair-growers. Mr. Jacobs is secretary and general
manager of the Institute of Medicine Manufacturers; he is, in fact, a
member of the old Southern patent-medicine aristocracy. His father, J.
F. Jacobs, was author of a profound treatise on “The Economic Necessity
and the Moral Validity of the Prepared Medicine Business.”

*J. Houston Goudiss*. Mr. Goudiss appears to be the missing link in the
menagerie of medicine men, vitamin men, and ad-men who crowd the big
tent of the Washington lobby and do Chautauqua work in the field. On
November 16th last he appeared before the convention of the New York
State Federation of Women’s Clubs, donned the mantle of the late Dr.
Harvey W. Wiley, and begged his hearers to oppose the Tugwell Bill. He
said in part:

> So far as I am known to the American public, I am known as a crusader
> for the better health of our people....Early in my career I came under
> the benign influence of the late Dr. Harvey W. Wiley. I was privileged
> to support him in his work...Were Dr. Wiley alive today, I am sure
> that he would be standing here instead of me. And if I presume to wear
> his mantle, it is because I feel that the great urgency of the
> situation calls upon me to do so....When I was first informed that our
> Congress was ready to consider a new pure food and drugs law...I was
> exultant....Later when I read the proposed law...my heart fell with
> foreboding. I recognized it as only another overzealous measure like
> our unhappy Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act....The Tugwell
> Bill is fraught with danger....

About that Harvey W. Wiley mantle the widow of Dr. Wiley, in the course
of an eloquent plea for the Tugwell Bill at the December hearing, said:
“I have never heard Dr. Wiley mention Mr. C. Houston Goudiss, and
inquiry at the Department of Agriculture discloses the fact that no
correspondence between Dr. Wiley and Mr. Goudiss between 1905 and 1911,
when Dr. Wiley resigned, is on file.”

And now about Mr. Goudiss himself: He publishes the *Forecast*, a
monthly magazine full of vitamin chatter not unrelated to Mr. Goudiss’s
activities as broadcaster over Station WOR for various and sundry food
products. He is author of *Eating Vitamins* and other books also of a
signed advertisement for Phillips’ Milk of Magnesia. His Elmira speech
was promptly sent out as a press release by the Proprietary Association,
and he also fought the Tugwell Bill over the radio.

The organizational set-up of the drug men, the food men, the medicine
men, and the ad-men is almost as complicated as that of the Insull
holding companies. At the top sits the High Council of the Drug
Institute, an association of associations, formed originally to fight
the cut-rate drug stores. The Proprietary Association, the Institute of
Medicine Manufacturers, and the United Medicine Manufacturers, all have
booths in this big tent. The last-named organization came right out in
the open, whooping, yelling, and rattling the wampum belt. The Food and
Drug Administration knows them well, and the public would know them
better if this department of government were authorized by law to
publicize its files. Here are a few of the most eminent and vocal
patriots and purity gospelers:

*President J. M. (Toma Tablets) Ewing*. Toma Tablets are innocuously
labeled, but advertised for stomach ulcers, The advertising clause of
the Copeland Bill is what is worrying Mr. Ewing.

*Vice President I. R. (Health Questions Answered) Blackburn*. Mr.
Clinton Robb, the legal magician for the U. M. M. A., fixed up the
labels of the Blackburn products, which rejoice in a string of notices
of judgment. These products are sold through an advertising column
headed “Health Questions Answered.” You write to Dr. Theodore Beck, who
answers the questions in this column, and the good doctor informs you
that one or more of the Blackburn products is good for what ails you.
It’s as simple as that.

*Vice President George Reese* is at present slightly handicapped in
selling venereal-disease remedies by the seizure by the Food and Drug
Administration a month ago of one of his nostrums—not the first action
of this kind, judging by the notices of judgment against this firm.

*Vice President Earl E. (Syl-vette) Runner* can boast a dozen or more
notices of judgment against his many products, the most prominent of
which, Syl-vette, was seized only a short time ago. This “reducing
agent” is a cocoa-sugar beverage that keeps your stomach from feeling
too empty while a diet does the slenderizing.

*D. A. (Gallstones) Lundy*, of the Board of Managers of the U. M. M. A.,
advertises: “Gallstones. Don’t operate. You make a bad condition worse.
Treat the cause in a sensible, painless, inexpensive way at home.” But,
alas, the proposed new law forbids the advertising of any drug for
gallstones, declaring the disease to be one for which self -medication
is especially dangerous. Perhaps this explains Mr. Lundy’s fervid
letters to Senators demanding the dismissal and prosecution of Chief
Campbell of the Food and Drug Administration on the ground that the
latter has been improperly spending the Federal Government’s money for
propaganda.

*William M. (Nue-Ovo) Krause*, of the membership committee of the U. M.
M. A. Mr. Krause’s Research Laboratories, Inc., of Portland, Oregon,
labeled Nue-Ovo as a cure for rheumatism until 1929 when the Food and
Drug Administration seized the product and forced a change of the label.
Nue-Ovo is still widely advertised in the West as a cure for rheumatism
and arthritis.

*Kenneth (Vogue Powder) Muir*, of the Board of Managers of the U. M. M.
A. When Mr. Muir’s Vogue Antiseptic Powder was seized in 1930, it was
being recommended not only for genito-urinary affections of men and
women but also in the treatment of diphtheria.

*T. S. (Renton’s Hydrocine Tablets) Strong*, of the Board of Managers of
the U. M. M. A., is a partner in Strong, Cobb & Company of Cleveland,
pharmaceutical chemists who manufacture products for other concerns.
There are notices of judgment against venereal-disease remedies and a
contraceptive manufactured by them. This firm also makes Renton’s
Hydrocine Tablets, a cinchophen product sold for rheumatism to which,
according to the American Medical Association, many deaths have been
directly traced.

*C. C. (Kow-Kare) Parlin*. For months now Mr. Parlin, research director
of the Curtis Publishing Company, assumed much of the task of mobilizing
and directing the heterogeneous but impassioned hosts of purity
gospelers that fought the Tugwell Bill. Mr. Parlin is a statistician, a
highbrow, and no end respectable. Moreover, he represents, indirectly at
least, the *Ladies’ Home Journal* and the *Country Gentleman*. In their
February, 1934, issues both of these Curtis properties published
editorials, written in language strikingly similar to Mr. Parlin’s
recent speeches and signed writings, to the effect that in their
advertising pages they had struggled to be pure—well, pure enough—and
that the new bill was just painting the lily.

How pure is pure? The February issue of the *Country Gentleman* contains
advertisements of several products which would be subject to
prophylactic treatment if an effective law against misleading
advertising were passed. The February issue of the *Ladies’ Home
Journal*, which says that for more than a generation it has “exercised
what we consider to be proper supervision over all copy offered for our
pages,” contains advertisements of at least eight products whose claims
would require modification if the proposed bill became law. The *Ladies’
Home Journal*’s “pure-enough” list includes Pepsodent, Fleischmann’s
Yeast, Ovaltine, Listerine, Vapex, Musterole, Vicks Vapo Rub, and Pond’s
creams. In addition to some of the foregoing, the *Country Gentleman*
stands back of advertisements of Ipana, Toxite, Sergeant’s Dog
Medicines, Bag Balm, and Kow-Kare. Concerning the last-named product,
the fact-minded veterinary of the Food and Drug Administration comments
as follows:

> This used to be sold as Kow-Kure, which purported to be a remedy for
> contagious abortion, until trouble threatened with the Pure Food and
> Drug Administration. No drug or combination of drugs has any remedial
> value in treating contagious abortion. The danger of these nostrums is
> that the farmer relies upon them.

There is one obvious lack in the foregoing list of purity gospelers. It
includes no women. We therefore hasten to present Gertrude B. Lane,
editor of the *Woman’s Home Companion*.

In the *Woman’s Home Companion*’s “index of products advertised,” the
statement is made that “the appearance in *Woman’s Home Companion* is a
specific warranty of the product advertised and of the integrity of the
house sponsoring the advertisement.” Why, then, did Miss Lane oppose the
bill? Was she alarmed by the fact that the *Woman’s Home Companion*
publishes as pure some of the same misleading advertisements that appear
in the *Ladies’ Home Journal*, already referred to, and that would be
embarrassed by the advertising provision of the Copeland Bill? It is a
great industry: women editors, publication statisticians, ad-men,
vitamin men, medicine men, cosmeticians, all in the same boat and rowing
for dear life against a rising tide of public opinion which demands that
this grotesque, collusive parody of manufacturing, distributing and
publishing services be compelled to make some sort of sense and decency
no matter how much deflation of vested interests is required.
