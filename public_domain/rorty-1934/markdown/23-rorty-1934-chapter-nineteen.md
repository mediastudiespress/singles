CHAPTER 19
==========

*EVOLUTION OF THE AMERICAN HERO*
--------------------------------

THE emergence of organized and incorporated salesmanship as the
characteristic phenomenon of the American society, the transmigration of
the soul of the Fourth Estate into the material body of the advertising
business—these developments can be viewed as logical sequences in the
evolution of industrial capitalism; they can also be studied as the end
products of a social philosophy. In this chapter we shall attempt to
outline the ideological evolution as it appears in the life and works of
significant American personalities. Benjamin Franklin, Jay Cooke, P. T.
Barnum, Henry Ward Beecher, Elbert Hubbard, Bruce Barton: what these men
thought and did and said was doubtless determined largely by the
economic environment in which they rose to power and influence. But
their attitudes, acts and utterances served to rationalize and thereby
to promote the material evolution, in the study of which the economist
specializes. What we look for, in the evidence of these lives, is the
religion of salesmanship which became more and more, after the turn of
the century, the religion of advertising. What we find is a kind of
sequence of crowd heroes, each modeling himself more or less on the ones
preceding. They are middle-class heroes, all of them, and the crown and
glory of the towering structure of rationalization which they erected is
the identification of the Christ mission with the mission of the
middle-class salesman and advertising man, which was accomplished by Mr.
Barton in *The Man Nobody Knows*.

Even today the masthead of the *Saturday Evening Post* bears the proud
statement “Founded by Benjamin Franklin.” The statement is true in
spirit if not in fact. The *Saturday Evening Post* is the most
influential advertising medium in America—in the world for that matter.
And the social and political philosophy of its publisher derives clearly
from the sly wisdom of that ineffable parvenu, that Yankee all-rightnick
of genius who signed himself “Poor Richard.” Franklin serves as a point
of departure because he was a business-minded pragmatist. He was not a
Babbitt and it is impossible to conceive of Franklin, a man of genius,
playing the role of a Hubbard or a Barton a century later. But on the
other hand it seems fair to credit Franklin with laying the ground-work
of the American acquisitive ethic.

### *BENJAMIN FRANKLIN*

“Remember, that time is money...Remember, that credit is money. If a man
lets money be on my hands after it is due, he gives me the interest, or
so much as I can make of it during that time. Remember, that money is of
the prolific, generating nature. Money can beget money, and its
offspring can beget more, and so on. Remember this saying, ’*the good
paymaster is lord of another man’s purse.*’ He that is known to pay
punctually and exactly to the time he promises may at any time and on
any occasion raise all the money his friends can spare...The most
trifling actions that affect a man’s credit are to be regarded. The
sound of your hammer at five in the morning or eight at night, heard by
a creditor, makes him easy six months longer; but if he sees you at a
billiard table or hears your voice at a tavern, when you should be at
work, he sends for his money the next day.”

Remember, remember. Remember, in the matter of sex, its utilitarian
aspect; sexualize to promote health or for the sober procreation of
children; “do not marry for money, but marry where money is.” If as a
young man you cannot afford to marry, choose your mistress wisely,
preferably an older woman, since a pretty face adds nothing of utility
or substantial enjoyment to the transaction and moreover the older women
are so grateful.”

Franklin was careful to be good because, honesty being the best policy,
it paid him to be good. And when he was not careful to be good, he was
careful to be careful.

“I grew convinced that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings
between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of
life...Revelation had indeed no weight with me as such; but I
entertained an opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad
because they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them,
yet probably those actions might be forbidden because they were bad for
us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us in their own nature,
all the circumstances of things considered.”

The utilitarian point of view could scarcely be made more explicit. But
Franklin achieved a further logical extension of the utilitarian
philosophy, to which Weber calls attention in “The Protestant Ethic.”

“Now, all Franklin’s moral attitudes are colored with utilitarianisms.
Honesty is useful, because it assures credit; so are punctuality,
industry, frugality, and that is the reason they are virtues. A logical
deduction from this would be that where, for instance, the appearance of
honesty serves the same purpose, that would suffice, and an unnecessary
surplus of this virtue would evidently appear to Franklin’s eyes as
unproductive waste. And as a matter of fact, the story in his
autobiography of his conversion to those virtues, or the discussion of
the value of a strict maintenance of the appearance of modesty, the
assiduous belittlement of one’s own desserts in order to gain general
recognition later, confirms this impression. According to Franklin,
those virtues, like all others, are only in so far virtues as they are
actually useful to the individual, and the surrogate of mere appearances
is always sufficient when it accomplishes the end in view. It is a
conclusion which is inevitable for strict utilitarianism.”

Compare this accurate characterization of Poor Richard’s credo with the
attitude of the manufacturers of Creomulsion, a proprietary remedy,
expressed in a form letter designed to coerce newspaper publishers into
attacking the Tugwell Pure Food and Drugs Bill:

> Gentlemen: You are about to lose a substantial amount of advertising
> revenue from food, drug, and cosmetic manufacturers. Your pocketbook
> is about to be filched and you will see how if you will personally
> study...the enclosed copy of the Tugwell Bill. This bill was
> introduced by *two doctors*....You publish your paper for profit and
> as a service to your community. *In most virile business organizations
> the altruistic policies in the final analysis are means to the primary
> end which is profit*. (My italics J. R.)...An isolated editorial or
> two will not suffice....You need to take an aggressive stand against
> this measure. You need to bring all personal pressure you can upon
> your senators and representatives. You need to enlighten and thereby
> arouse your public against this bill which is calculated to greatly
> restrict personal rights. If this bill should become law we will be
> forced to cancel immediately every line of Creomulsion advertising....

Surely the italicized sentence expresses the essence of the Poor Richard
Philosophy and shows that the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin still lives in
the hearts and minds of his countrymen, especially those who, like the
manufacturers of Creomulsion, are engaged in manipulating the techniques
of rule by advertising.

### *JAY COOKE*

Vernon L. Parrington, in the third volume of his *Main Currents of
American Thought*, remarks that “in certain respects Jay Cooke may be
reckoned the first modern American.” He financed the Civil War, and in
the course of his operations developed and used on the grand scale most
of the techniques of the modern advertiser and mass propagandist. With
the Liberty Loan drives in mind, compare Parrington’s summary of Cooke’s
pioneering achievements.

Under his bland deacon-like exterior was the mind of a realist....If he
were to lure dollars from old stockings in remote chimney corners he
must “sell” patriotism to his fellow Americans; and to do that
successfully he must manufacture a militant public opinion. The soldier
at the front, he announced in a flood of advertisements, must be
supported at the rear....To induce slacker dollars to become fighting
dollars he placed his agents in every neighborhood, in newspaper
offices, in banks, in pulpits patriotic forerunners of the “one-minute
men” of later drives....He subsidized the press with a lavish hand, not
only the metropolitan dailies but the obscurist country weeklies. He
employed an army of hack-writers to prepare syndicated matter and he
scattered paying copy broadcast.... He bought the pressings of whole
vineyards and casks of pure wine flowed in an endless stream to
strategic publicity points. Rival brokers hinted that he was debauching
the press, but the army of greenbacks marching to the front was his
reply. It all cost a pretty penny, but the government was liberal with
commissions and when all expenses were deducted perhaps $2,000,000 of
profits remained in the vaults of the firm to be added to the many other
millions which the prestige of the government agency with its free
advertising brought in its train.

Having successfully sold a war, Jay Cooke turned to selling railroad
stock—specifically, the Northern Pacific. He kept much of his war
publicity machine intact and used it both for this purpose and to shape
public opinion in regard to taxation funding, and the currency—naturally
in his own interests. But the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War
smashed Cooke’s European bond-selling campaign and the fall of the house
of Cooke precipitated the panic of ’73.

Jay Cooke carried into the realm of national finance and politics the
morals, ethics and philosophy of a frontier trader and real estate
speculator. Profoundly ignorant of social or economic principles he
wrote or had written for him contributions to economic theory which were
little more than clumsy and transparent rationalizations of a money
lender’s greed. *But*—he was successful in amassing great wealth; hence
he was, during his heyday, a popular hero whose opinions on any subject
were listened to with great respect by his fellow Americans. Moreover,
he was, as Parrington noted: “Scrupulous in all religious duties, a kind
husband, a generous friend, benevolent in all worthy charities, simple
and democratic in his tastes, ardently patriotic.” As a man, he seems to
have had neither blood nor brains—Franklin had both—but in his life and
work he applied the middle-class virtues of Poor Richard to the
acquisitive opportunities of the Gilded Age. So that to a people given
over to the worship of money-progress and money-opportunity he was a
kind of Moses, envied and revered in life by all classes and worshipped
by his biographer.

In brief, he was a mean and sorry little parvenu; and one of the
founding fathers of the religion of salesmanship and advertising. His
career marks a step in the evolution of the American crowd hero, and in
the evolution of the American pseudoculture.

### *P. T. BARNUM*

Salesmanship and showmanship are variants of the same technique and both
find their sanctions in Franklin’s utilitarian ethic. America’s greatest
showman belongs in the historical sequence of American crowd heroes for
a number of reasons. In him the doctrine of justification by works
receives its extreme pragmatic application in “the people like to be
fooled” and “there is a sucker born every minute.” That this greasy
faker, this vulgar horse-trading yokel could have successfully worn the
cloak of piety all his life; that his autobiography, the prototype of
the American success story, was for years an unrivaled best seller,
standing alongside of Franklin’s *Autobiography* and *Pilgrim’s
Progress* in many thousands of American homes; that he was, for
multitudes of his fellow citizens a model American—all this is difficult
to believe at this distance. Yet his biographer, M. R. Werner, supplies
impressive evidence that it was so.

> When you give one of your daughters away in matrimony, advise her to
> imitate Charity Barnum; when your son leaves home to try his luck on
> the ocean of life, give him Barnum for a guide; when you yourself are
> in trouble and misery and near desperation, take from Barnum’s life
> and teachings consolation and courage.

Henry Hilgert, a Baltimore preacher, stood up in his pulpit and said
this to his congregation and there is every reason to believe that he
expressed with substantial accuracy the contemporary popular evaluation
of the great showman. The man he was talking about started his career in
a country store in Bethel, Connecticut, watering the rum, sanding the
sugar and dusting the pepper that he sold to his fellow townsmen,
cheating and being cheated, playing cruel practical jokes, all strictly
in accordance with the savage mores of that idyllic New England
community, where the public whipping post menaced the ungodly arid
suicides were buried at the crossroads. From this he advanced to running
a public lottery and with the profits went to New York, where the
advertising of Dr. Brandeth’s Pills was helping James Gordon Bennett to
lay the foundations of the modern American newspaper.

At thirty-one Barnum was writing advertisements for the Bowery
Amphitheater at four dollars a week. He was a “natural” at the business
and used his skill to get control of the American Museum where he began
to advertise in earnest. When the posters of the negro violinist didn’t
pull, he changed them to show the violinist playing upside down. Then
they pulled, and the customers didn’t mind, because Barnum gave them a
flea circus and a pair of albinos as added attractions. He advertised
his theatrical performances as religious lectures, and the best and most
devout people flocked to them. His advertisements of Joyce Heth, “the
nurse of George Washington,” the Japanese mermaid, the white whales,
Jenny Lind and Jumbo drained the dictionary of adjectives. Modern movie
advertising has added nothing new or better to the technique. He
stood—with Tom Thumb—before kings. He lectured to thousands on power of
will and success through godliness. He invested his money in factories
and in real estate developments designed to house religious working men
who didn’t drink, smoke or chew. He went bankrupt, but with the $150,000
his creditors couldn’t get he “came back” gloriously and made another
fortune.

To the museum which Barnum gave to Tufts College there still come on
Sunday afternoons good people from the surrounding suburbs who stand in
awe before the stuffed carcass of Jumbo. And the college glee club still
sings:

> Who was P. T. Barnum?  
> The first in tents  
> And consequently hence  
> The first in the realm of dollars and cents.  
> The first to know  
> That a real fine show  
> Must have a gen-u-ine Jumbo.  
> The first to come  
> With the needful sum  
> To found our college mus-e-um!  
> Pee Tee Barnum!!

### *HENRY WARD BEECHER*

Barnum had nerve, a kind of bucolic Yankee hardihood which enabled him
to trade in godliness with the same pokerfaced effrontery that
characterized his circus barking. That, with a certain crude but
vigorous histrionism, would appear to be his contribution to the
evolution of the American crowdhero type.

Henry Ward Beecher, in contrast, was a deplorable ’fraidcat all his
days. But he was a much more complex and interesting figure than the
great showman, and embodied more richly the conflicting strains of the
cultural heritage. He, too, was a middle-class crowd hero. Yet
curiously, his unrivaled eminence as a preacher and editor, in a period
when the influence of the church and the church press was enormous,
never quite gave him the mass influence which Barnum clearly had. One
reason for this, of course, was the scandal which clouded his later
years. But there is perhaps another and even more important reason.
Beecher, though a showman both by nature and by long training, had a
private impurity which is incompatible with pure showmanship, pure
salesmanship, pure money-making. Beecher took himself seriously. He was
a faker, a liar and a cheat, as was Barnum, and at bottom he was just
about as vulgar as Barnum. But Beecher had a personal mission—to
repudiate the harsh Calvinism of his father, the loveless despotism of
that barren Litchfield parsonage, and proclaim the gospel of love. So
Henry Ward Beecher struggled; a scared child, he begged the love of
women which he never earned; women whom he later repudiated. Seemingly
they loved him; at least they never gave him the hatred which his
cowardly betrayals richly deserved. Why? Perhaps because they pitied him
and saw that he was struggling genuinely after his fashion; struggling
to be himself, to defy the Calvinist God, to assert the Tightness of the
tremendous emotionality which was his greatest endowment. Victoria
Woodhull, that extraordinary woman, probably came close to stating the
truth about Beecher when she wrote:

> The immense physical potency of Mr. Beecher, and the indomitable
> urgency of his great nature for the intimacy and embraces of the noble
> and cultured women about him, instead of being a bad thing as the
> world thinks, or thinks it thinks, or professes to think it thinks, is
> one of the noblest and grandest endowments of this truly great and
> representative man. Plymouth Church has lived and fed, and the healthy
> vigor of public opinion for the last quarter of a century has been
> augmented and strengthened from the physical amativeness of Rev. Henry
> Ward Beecher.

How Beecher writhed when he read this! And with what maledictions the
brethren of Plymouth Church rejected this intolerable tribute to their
adored pastor! For it was not precisely Henry Ward Beecher’s business to
revolutionize the sexual mores of his time. Not his the stuff of which
martyrs are made. Earlier in his career, Beecher had rejected this role.
When his brother, his father, most of his more courageous parishioners
had embraced the cause of abolition Beecher had played safe on the
slavery question. Instead he had chosen as his pulpiteering stock in
trade the denunciation of the liquor traffic. And the jibe of a
distiller whom he had attacked was well earned:

> You cannot justify slavery by talking about the making of
> whiskey....Why is thy tongue still and thy pen idle when the
> sentiments of thy brother and thy church on slavery are promulgated?
> Thou idle boaster—where is thy vaunted boldness?...You are greatly to
> be pitied, even by a distiller.

Just what was Henry Ward Beecher’s business, his “usefulness” to the
preservation of which he sacrificed friend after friend along with his
own honor and decency? It was the preaching business. It was also
indirectly the advertising department of the real estate business. In
*Henry Ward Beecher: An American Portrait*, Paxton Hibben writes:

> The investment character of his church was a matter that every
> metropolitan minister of that day was expected to bear in mind. Pews
> were auctioned off to the highest bidder and church scrip bore seven
> per cent interest. A popular preacher was, also, a better real estate
> advertisement than whole pages of publicity. Indeed, such a preacher
> as Henry Ward Beecher proved, readily secured pages of publicity for
> the neighborhood in which he officiated. For it was the day when
> church going was the only amusement permitted the godly, and divine
> service received the attention from the press later accorded theaters
> and social activities.

Beecher had trained hard for this business. In a later lecture at Yale,
which took the form of a success story, he said:

> I got this idea: that the Apostles were accustomed to feel for a
> ground on which the people and they stood together; a common ground
> where they could meet. Then they stored up a large number of the
> particulars of knowledge, which belonged to everybody; when they get
> that knowledge that everybody would admit, placed in proper form
> before their minds, then they brought it to bear upon them with all
> their excited heart and feeling.

It is not difficult to recognize this as essentially the formula of Mr.
Barton’s syndicated lay preachments. In fact, Beecher’s pulpiteering and
Barton’s syndicated essays are essentially advertisements designed to
“sell” the acquisitive society to itself. Beecher’s method was in all
important respects the method by which an advertising agency after
appropriate “research” arrives at the most effective “copy slant” with
which to sell a new toothpaste or a new gargle. The basic conviction
which underlies all these enterprises in showmanship, salesmanship and
advertising is expressed in one of Mr. Barton’s favorite mottoes: “There
is somebody wiser than anybody. That somebody is everybody.”

However, one must admit that although Beecher unquestionably had the
authentic Big Idea, he was too neurotic and too blundering ever quite to
come through as a successful advertising man. He was forever picking the
wrong theme song at the wrong time. Take his attitude toward Lincoln:

> It will be difficult for a man to be born lower than he was. He is an
> unshapely man. He is a man that bears evidence of not having been
> educated in schools or in circles of refinement.

Thousands of middle class American parvenues took that view of Lincoln
but it took a pompous blatherskite like Beecher to plump out with it
from the pulpit of a Christian church. And many of Beecher’s
parishioners had sense enough to see that Lincoln was not merely a
better man but a better politician than Beecher. But there we run again
into Beecher ’s limiting private impurity. He was not merely a snob, but
a sincere snob.

Beecher was to achieve worse flops than this. In the year 1887, when
strikes were sweeping the country, Beecher undertook to rehabilitate his
smirched reputation by coming out as the defender of “law and order” and
“life, liberty, and *prosperity*” to quote his significant revision of
Jefferson. He said:

> Is the great working class oppressed?...yes, undoubtedly, it is...God
> has intended the great to be great and the little to be little...the
> trades union, originated under the European system, destroys
> liberty....I do not say that a dollar a day is enough to support a
> working man, but it is enough to support a man!...not enough to
> support a man and five children if a man would insist on smoking and
> drinking beer....But the man who cannot live on bread and water is not
> fit to live.

One can scarcely do better than to quote Paxton Hibben’s comment on this
catastrophic muff, which the cartoonists exploited for years afterwards:

> As the slogan of a great crusade in the leadership of which Beecher
> could reconquer the esteem of the American public, this bread and
> water doctrine somehow lacked pulling power.

Beecher was not so much a cynic as a charlatan, and the limiting vice of
charlatans is that they tend to take themselves seriously. That is bad
business and the more sophisticated charlatans like Elbert Hubbard are
careful not to handicap their operations by private impurities of this
sort. Moreover, Beecher was sloppy and careless. Take his flier in
advertising in connection with Jay Cooke’s Northern Pacific promotion
operations.

In January, 1870, Beecher received $15,000 worth of Northern Pacific
stock for the express purpose of influencing the public mind to favor
the new railroad. Beecher’s aid was to include the use of the *Christian
Union*, a newspaper which he edited. The matter came to light and
Beecher was roundly denounced. The moral would seem to be that Beecher
should have been more careful as were some of his parishioners, like
“Tearful Tommy” Shearman, clerk of Plymouth Church, who were also in on
the proposition. The modern method of accomplishing the required
enlightenment of public opinion would have been for Jay Cooke to place a
substantial advertising contract with the *Christian Union* and then
threaten to cancel it if Beecher failed to “co-operate.” Theodore
Tilton, the man whose wife Beecher begged love from and whom he ruined
and drove into exile—Theodore Tilton, also an editor, told Jay Cooke to
go to hell. But Tilton was a good deal of a man.

Beecher, like other divided souls, was not his own master. His physical
amativeness appears to have been genuine, and he was an authentic
sentimentalist, if there is such a thing. And he really did hate his
father and his father’s Calvinism. So in the end, when it was fairly
safe to do so, Beecher came clean on one count. He denounced the
Calvinist hell, whose flames had been licking his conscience for all
those many years. Call it wish-fulfilment if you like, but Beecher stood
up in Plymouth Church and said:

> To tell me that back of Christ is a God who for unnumbered centuries
> has gone on creating man and sweeping them like dead flies—nay, like
> living ones—into hell is to ask me to worship a being as much worse
> than the conception of a medieval devil as can be imagined....I will
> not worship cruelty. I will worship love—that sacrifices itself for
> the good of those who err, and that is as patient with them as a
> mother is with a sick child.

On the whole this was a pretty good negative-appeal advertisement. But
it wasn’t entirely well-timed. Beecher had to alter the slant several
times before he hit the bull’s eye of public opinion—that wise
“everybody” to whom he dedicated his “usefulness.”

Not a pleasant figure, Beecher. Half sincere and more than half neurotic
charlatans are never pleasant, nor are their lives at all happy. And in
age their faces look like the wrath of God.

### *ELBERT HUBBARD*

In the sequence thus far we have seen a statesman, a financier, a
showman and a preacher, using the philosophy and techniques of
salesmanship and presenting themselves, with greater or less success, as
heroes for the admiration of the crowd. None of them was a professional
advertising man. But all of them were crowd leaders engaged in selling
themselves; also in selling the middle-class acquisitive ethic, and in
rounding out the body of rationalization which the expansion of American
industrial capitalism required. Advertising, as Mr. Roy Dickinson,
president of *Printers’ Ink*, has pointed out, is not an independent
economic or social entity. It is merely a function of business
management, and all these American crowd heroes were business men,
first, last and always.

In Elbert Hubbard, however, we encounter the advertising man *per se*, a
professional of professionals. All the others had “callings” in which,
to earn divine favor, they were obliged to be successful. To be
successful they were obliged to employ the techniques of salesmanship,
of showmanship, of advertising, since these were the most effective
techniques of leadership and of rule in the system as they found it. But
Hubbard was called to the pure priesthood of advertising from the
beginning, and by his success in this “calling” became a crowd hero.
True, they called him a great writer, and a great printer, but the rose
of advertising smells the same by whatever name it is called; in effect
he never wrote or printed anything *but* advertisements. This, as we
shall see, is equally true of that other great professional, Bruce
Barton.

Elbert Hubbard deserves much more careful and detailed study than he has
received at the hands of his biographers. He was born in 1856 in
Bloomington, Illinois, the son of a physician. At thirty he was already
a highly successful advertising man in the employ of a Buffalo, N. Y.,
soap manufacturer; among the sales techniques which he helped to develop
were the use of premiums and various devices of credit extension. In
1892, he had made enough money to retire and give himself a college
education. He entered Harvard as an undergraduate, but soon gave it up.
Obviously President Eliot and his academic co-workers didn’t know what
America was all about. Hubbard wasn’t sure himself, but he had a hunch.
It was the period of rococo enthusiasms in art, in economics, in
politics. Hubbard went to England, met William Morris, and cheerfully
appropriated all the salable elements of Morris’s social and aesthetic
philosophy. He knew what he wanted, did Hubbard, and especially what he
didn’t want. He wasn’t having any of Morris’s militant socialism for one
thing. As far as radicalism was concerned, Franklin’s “surrogate of
appearance” was what Hubbard required—in other words a “front.” And in
his later career as strike-breaker and big business apologist he
discarded even that. As for art, Hubbard made haste on his return to
America to debauch everything that was good in the Morris aesthetic and
to heighten and distort what was bad to the proportions of burlesque.
The quantity of typographic and other sham “craftsmanship” spawned by
Hubbard’s East Aurora workshop is too huge even to catalogue. Some of
the de luxe editions he got out sold for $500 apiece. He knew his
American self-made business man, did Hubbard, and the cultural
“surrogates of appearance” which the tycoons of the nineties required
for their libraries were hand-illuminated by a “genius”—long hair,
flowing tie and everything—to the order of the patron.

The “people like to be fooled” said Barnum. But Hubbard was sharp enough
to see that the enterprise required none of the elaborate paraphernalia
of dwarfs, elephants and white whales that the pioneer showman
assembled. Hubbard was a one-man circus, and a one-man Chautauqua. He
edited and wrote a one-man magazine, *The Philistine*, and ran a one-man
strike-breaking agency. A solo artist if ever there was one. True he had
helpers and disciples, but none was ever permitted to share the
limelight with the only original Fra Elbertus. His point of view about
the help was accurately expressed in *A Message to Garcia*.

> It is not book learning young men need, but a stiffening of the
> rertebrae which will cause them to be loyal to trust, to act promptly,
> to concentrate their energies, do the thing, “carry a message to
> Garcia.”

A hard taskmaster, the Fra, who got the efficiency idea early and gave
it its necessary ethical and moral rationalization. Carping critics
suggested that Hubbard’s chief industry at East Aurora was working his
disciples. But big business seized upon *A Message to Garcia* as a
revelation from Sinai, and the Fra simply coined money from then on.
Hubbard wrote in this classic manifesto which corporation executives
bought and distributed by the hundred thousand to their employees:

“He would drop a tear for the men who are struggling to carry on a great
enterprise, whose working hours are not limited by the whistle and whose
hair is fast turning white through the struggle to hold in line dowdy
indifference, slipshod imbecility and heartless ingratitude which but
for their enterprise would be both hungry and homeless.”

That, it would appear, was the only cause over which Elbert Hubbard ever
dropped a genuine tear. It was his own cause because he was a capitalist
in his own right. (By 1911, his plant at East Aurora included two
hotels, a group of factory buildings, and a farm, and he had five
hundred people on his payroll.) It was also the cause of the expanding
capitalist economy and the correlative acquisitive ethic, which came to
full maturity during the two decades preceding the war.

One wonders a little at the harshness with which Hubbard rebuffed the
craving of the white-collar slave for “book-learning.” He himself was a
kind of philosophical and literary magpie who lined his nest with
trifles gathered from the most recondite sources, both ancient and
modern. These, after having received a Hubbardian twist, were dished up
in the *Philistine* and the *Fra* as the authentic pot-distilled wisdom
of the sage of East Aurora.

He wrote so beautifully, sighed the newspaper critics of that May-tide
of commercial sentimentality which piled high and shattered itself upon
the realities of the war. In 1915, Elbert Hubbard went down with the
Lusitania, and the *Literary Digest* in recording the event, quoted this
tribute by Agnes Herbert which appeared in the London *Daily Chronicle*:

> Give me, I pray you, the magic of Elbert Hubbard. None of your Hardys,
> your Barries, your Kiplings for me. The pen of Elbert Hubbard, an\* it
> please you....Scoffers called him a literary faker. On occasion he was
> so. He popularized his knowledge of the great philosophers and
> transposed them so that the man in the street who would avoid the
> original teachers as he would the plague, swallowed the carefully
> wrapped up wisdom gratefully....Everything Elbert Hubbard touched was
> made beautiful by the magic of his mind. He was the greatest
> advertising writer in the States and his methods turned the crying of
> wares into a literary adventure. Each was a faceted gem not to be
> passed by.

This seems a little lush, perhaps. The tribute of one Harold Bolce,
writing under the title “Hubbard, the Homo, Plus” in the *Cosmopolitan*
for March, 1911, is more to the point.

> Elbert Hubbard realized long ago that he was an heir of the ages and
> he has foreclosed. He is rich, happy, healthy and wise. He has the
> woman he loves....He has struck pay dirt on Parnassus....
>

The Fra’s production of advertising copy, not counting his *Little
Journeys to the Homes of the Great*—including the home of Lydia
Pinkham’s Vegetable Compound—was enormous. As Joseph Wood Krutch pointed
out in *The Nation*,

Toward the end of Hubbard’s career, he became overgreedy and
overconfident. The small change of lecture fees and book royalties was
not enough. He had become a pretty important fellow and felt that he was
worth important money. His price on one recorded occasion, for a job of
literary strike-breaking, was about $200,000. Does this sound excessive?
It sounded a little high even to John D. Rockefeller and to Ivy Lee, his
public relations counsel in the lamentable affair of the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company. The correspondence was reprinted in *Harper’s Weekly*,
Jan. 30, 1915, under the title, “Elbert Hubbard’s Price,” and the first
letter is dated June 9, 1914.

> Dear Mr. Rockefeller:
>
> I have been out in Colorado and know a little about the situation
> there. It seems to me that your stand is eminently right, proper and
> logical. A good many of the strikers are poor, unfortunate, ignorant
> foreigners who imagine there is a war on \[the bullets that riddled
> the strikers’ tents at Ludlow were doubtless purely imaginary J. R.\]
> and that they are fighting for liberty. They are men with the fighting
> habit preyed on by agitators....

Hubbard went on to cite an article he had written about. the Michigan
copper country and said he was writing one about Colorado. He mentioned
his mailing list of 1,000,000 names of members of Boards of Trade,
Chambers of Commerce, Advertising Clubs, Rotarians, Jovians,
schoolteachers, judges and Members of Congress. He quoted a price of
$200 a thousand for extra copies of the issue of *The Fra* in which his
planned article would appear. He concluded:

> Just here, I cannot refrain from expressing my admiration for those
> very industrious, hard-working people, Bill Haywood, Charles Moyer,
> Mother Jones, Emma Goldman, Lincoln Steffens and Upton Sinclair. Why
> don’t you benefit the world...(by stating the Rockefellers’ side of
> the case. J. R.)?

Elbert missed out on that one, although he was persistent enough. He
played golf with the elder Rockefeller. He wrote repeatedly to the
well-known Mr. Welborn, President of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.
“Do I make myself clear, boys?” he seemed to be saying. He did. Ivy Lee
cannily suggested that Elbert be permitted every facility to gather
material for his article. Then if Mr. Welborn liked it, he could
doubtless arrange about the price. Ivy Lee knew his Fra. He wasn’t
buying any pig in a poke from Elbert Hubbard.

The proposition, as the editor of *Harper’s Weekly* pointed out, was in
two parts:

1.  The Fra offered to sell his opinion.

2.  The Fra offered to make an investigation in support of his opinion.

The Fra’s one-man Chautauqua came to Middletown, N. Y. when the writer
was in high school and also working on the local daily paper. It came
twice in fact. The first year Elbert lectured on *The March of the
Centuries*. It was a hodge-podge of Thoreau, Whitman, Emerson,
Michelangelo and who not. I recall being a bit puzzled, although I
reported the lecture respectfully enough, as was proper considering the
eminence of the lecturer. The next year, I was a year older and so was
the Fra. He was getting pretty seedy, in fact, I thought. Moreover, his
lecture, under a different title, was word for word the same balderdash
he had given us the year before. The next day in the columns of the
*Middletown Daily Times-Press* I took out after him with shrill cries of
rage. The owner of the paper was away and I had fun. The piece was
picked up and reprinted widely. At the moment, as I remember it, Hubbard
had got himself a rating as a Bohemian immoralist, so that the up-state
editors had declared an open season on the Fra.

My employer, when he came back, was horrified. It was the first time in
the history of his management that the paper had printed an unkind word
about anybody. But the Fra didn’t mind—it was just so much publicity
grist for his mill. The public likes to be fooled.

There seems to be nothing final to say about Fra Elbertus except that he
advertised and sold everything and everybody he could lay his hands on:
William Morris, Michelangelo, Thoreau, Emerson, Karl Marx, Socrates and
Paracelsus. And himself, Elbert Hubbard, a founding father of the
advertising profession—“the most roundly gifted genius since Benjamin
Franklin.”
