CHAPTER 14
==========

*WHOSE SOCIAL SCIENTIST ARE YOU?*
---------------------------------

AS ADVERTISING became more and more an essential part of the mechanism
of sales promotion, and as our newspapers and magazines took definite
form as *advertising businesses*, the advertising profession became
highly respectable. It was part of the status quo of the acquisitive
society and could be effectively challenged only by persons and
interests standing outside this status quo.

As already indicated, the product of advertising was a culture, or
pseudoculture. Advertising was engaged in manufacturing precisely the
material which our economists, sociologists and psychologists are
supposed to study, measure and interpret—necessarily within some
framework of judgment. What framework? Where did our social scientists
stand during advertising’s period of expansion and conquest?

They stood aside for the most part while advertising proceeded to play
jackstraws with the “law” of supply and demand, and other items of
orthodox economic doctrine. Thornstein Veblen saw the thing clearly and
his brief treatment of advertising in *Absentee Ownership* remains today
the most exact description of the nature of the advertising phenomenon
which has yet appeared. But Veblen was a lone wolf all his days. And it
has been the journalists, publicists and engineers, rather than the
professors, who have made most effective application of Veblen’s
insights. Stuart Chase, a disciple of Veblen, has worked without
academic sanctions, while the director of Consumers’ Research, Mr. F. J.
Schlink, is an engineer, and Mr. Arthur Kallet, his collaborator in the
writing of *100,000,000 Guinea Pigs* is another. For the most part,
orthodox economists have either ignored advertising, or in very brief
and inadequate treatments, have complained gently about its “vulgarity,”
as if, in the nature of the case, it could be anything but vulgar. A
notable exception is the chapter on “Consumers in the Market” by
Professor Corwin Edwards in the second volume of *Economic Behavior* by
members of the Economics department of New York University. Against this
competent and forthright analysis, however, must be set the sort of
thing which Leverett S. Lyon, economist of Brooking’s Institute,
contributes to Volume I of the *Encyclopedia of Social Sciences*. I
quote here the concluding paragraph of Mr. Lyon’s article:

> Consumer advertising is the first rough effort of a society becoming
> prosperous to teach itself the use of the relatively great wealth of
> new resources, new techniques, and a reorganized production method.
> Whatever eventually becomes of advertising, society must provide some
> device for this task. Some agency must keep before the consumer the
> possibilities resulting from constant advance, for the world appears
> to be learning to produce goods ever faster. Today the voices crying
> most loudly in the wilderness of consumption are more concerned with
> noisily advertising the weaknesses of advertising than with patient
> teaching of standards of taste which will reform advertising by
> indirection. Other action is possible. An increase of government
> specifications would help, although not as much as is often thought,
> and they would require an enormous amount of advertising. What is most
> needed for American consumption is training in art and taste in a
> generous consumption of goods, if such there can be. If beauty is
> profitable, no manufacturer is desirous of producing crudity or
> vulgarity. Advertising, whether for good or ill, is the greatest force
> at work against the traditional economy of an age-long poverty as well
> as that of our own pioneer period; it is almost the only force at work
> against puritanism in consumption. It can infuse art into the things
> of life; and it will, if such an art is possible, and if those who
> realize what it is will let the people know.

Intelligent and honest advertising men, at least, will have no
difficulty in recognizing this as a piece of advertising copy about
advertising. Like practically all advertising copy it is a piece of
special pleading and its appearance in an otherwise excellently edited
reference work is calamitous enough in all conscience.

It may be observed incidentally that Mr. Lyon is a frequent contributor
to the advertising trade press. He stands well within the status quo,
not merely of orthodox economic teaching, but of the advertising
business itself. It is natural enough that he should rationalize and
justify the role of advertising in our society, while making the usual
pretense of “objectivity.”

The fact is, of course, that as advertising became powerful and
respectable it had a good many well-paid jobs to offer social
scientists, and that none of these jobs tolerated any degree of
“objectivity” whatsoever: Jobs of teaching merchandizing and market
analysis in schools of business administration; jobs for statisticians
as directors of research in advertising agencies; jobs for psychologists
in testing new devices of cozenage, measuring “consumer reactions,” etc.
There can be no doubt as to whom these social scientists belong. They
belong to the advertising business, and they can no more write
“objectively” about that business than a copy writer can write
objectively about his client’s gargles and gadgets.

With the rapid growth of the schools of business administration since
the war, these business-minded economists, psychologists, statisticians,
etc., came to rival in number and in influence their colleagues in the
departments of economics and psychology proper. But even the strictly
academic social scientists, practitioners of a “purer” discipline, found
increasing difficulty in sustaining their claim of “objectivity” and the
younger ones, especially the economists, pretty much gave it up. Both
the motivation and the futility of this claim are well analyzed by Mr.
Sidney Hook in an unpublished manuscript:

> The fascination of physical science for the social theorists is easy
> to explain. Not only does it possess the magic of success, but what is
> vastly more important, the promises of agreements and objectivity. In
> the popular mind, to be objective and to be “scientific” are
> practically synonymous terms. What is more natural, therefore, than
> the fact that in a field in which prejudice, bias, selective emphasis
> are notorious, there should be a constant appeal to a neutral point of
> view. It is this quest for objective truth from a neutral point of
> view, independent of value judgments, which has become the great
> fetich of American social science.
>
> It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the social activity which
> contributes the subject matter of the social sciences is an activity
> carried on by human beings in pursuit of definite ends. If we take
> these ends as our starting point nothing is clearer than the fact that
> these ends, whether they be of individuals or of classes, conflict.
> Social conflicts are a real and permanent feature of the society in

> are social classes. The attempt to evade this class conflict and to
> refuse to regard it under existing conditions as fundamental is behind
> the strenuous effort to emulate the “exact sciences” in which the only
> recognized conflict is between the “true” and the “false.”

Taking, as Mr. Hook suggests, the ends sought by advertising as the
proper starting point for a consideration of the phenomenon, let us
return to Mr. Lyon’s forensic summation and see what it amounts to. He
says: “Consumer advertising is the first rough effort of a society
becoming prosperous to teach itself the use of the relatively great
wealth of new resources, new techniques and a reorganized production
method.” In the first place, advertising is conducted by and for
advertisers, and the dissemination of a material culture which it
accomplishes is strictly in the interest of the advertiser, primarily,
and of the total apparatus of the advertising business secondarily. The
advertiser is concerned with “teaching” the consumer only in so far as
such teaching profits the advertiser and the routine product of
advertising is therefore pretty consistently mis-educational rather than
genuinely educational. This “teaching” involves not merely huge economic
wastes but a definite warping and conditioning of the consumer’s value
judgments into conformity with the profitmotivated interests of the
advertiser.

Mr. Lyon proposes, by implication, a “patient teaching of standards of
taste which will reform advertising by indirection.” A teaching by whom
and for whom? Advertising is itself a tremendous “educational” effort
which operates in the interest of the advertiser with incidental profit
to the consumer only in so far as he can disentangle the truth from a
mass of special pleading, this incidental profit being vastly
overbalanced by the mis-educational pressures exerted not merely on his
pocketbook but upon his “taste,” that is to say, his value judgments.
Advertising, as Veblen said, is not merely an enterprise in sales
promotion, but an enterprise in the production of customers which
necessarily becomes an enterprise in “creative psychiatry.” Does Mr.
Lyon propose that this huge *interested* mis-educational and
anti-cultural activity be balanced and corrected by another educational
activity? In whose interest? Financed and conducted by whom? By
Consumers’ Research, perhaps? By government? But why should any
government which pretends to govern in the interests of the people as a
whole proceed by “indirection”; that is to say, educate consumers to
resist in their own interest the “education” which advertisers
disseminate in *their* interest? Wouldn’t it be simpler to eliminate
your negatives first and then see how much and what kind of positive
education is required?

Advertising, says Mr. Lyon, “is almost the only force at work against
puritanism in consumption.” By what right and in whose behalf does he
introduce this value judgment into his argument? Maybe our people would
prefer a little more puritanism in consumption, intolerable as such an
attitude may be to advertisers operating in the “surplus economy” phase
of industrial capitalism. And does advertising really work against
puritanism in consumption? What do you mean, puritanism in consumption?
Buying wheat for what it is worth instead of “puffed wheat” at eight
times as much? Buying a radio instead of shoes for the baby?

Advertising, says Mr. Lyon, “can infuse art into the things of life, if
such an art is possible, and if those who realize what it is will let
the people know.” How? By more advertising, doubtless, along the lines
so frequently proposed by Mr. Bruce Barton and Mr. Walter Pitkin in the
interests, not of the “people” but of the advertiser and the advertising
business?

One gives space to such lamentable rationalizers as Mr. Lyon only
because he represents so typically the values, attitudes and motives of
the ad-man’s pseudoculture as they are currently set forth by
advertising apologists. We shall encounter precisely the same kind of
logical jabberwocky when we come to consider the radio and the movies.
Meanwhile, let us have a look at the rôle of the psychologists.
