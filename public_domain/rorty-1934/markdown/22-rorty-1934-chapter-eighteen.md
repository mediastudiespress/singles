CHAPTER 18
==========

*RELIGION AND THE AD-MAN*
-------------------------

WEEKS before real beer came back, the beer gardens sprang into bloom
along Fourteenth Street. They are cheap. Fifteen cents buys a roast beef
sandwich, a portion of beans, a portion of potatoes and a slop of thin
gravy. You sit at an enamel table, look and listen. Imitation tile.
Imitation Alps. Imitation Bavarian atmosphere. Imitation beer. Three
people sit at the next table: an imitation pimp, an imitation stage
mother and an imitation burlesque show manager. Maybe the burlesque show
manager is real. He is gray-haired, red-faced, thickset and voluble. He
declaims:

“I’m a faker. God in his blue canopy above—that’s out of Shakespeare—God
knows I’m a faker. When the priest baptized me, he shook the holy water
on my head (snap, snap) and said: ‘Taker, faker, faker!’”

I saw that. I heard that. If I had sat there long enough I am confident
I could have seen and heard anything. If one wishes to discover America,
all one has to do is to forget all the solemn and reasonable things that
solemn and reasonable people have spoken and written, and then go
listening and pondering into cheap restaurants, movie palaces, radio
studios, pulp magazine offices, police stations, five- and ten-cent
stores, advertising agencies. Out of this atomic, pulverized life, the
anarchic voices rise. They are shameless, these voices, and truthful,
and wise with a kind of bleak factual wisdom. Each atom speaks for
itself, to comfort itself, to assert itself against the overwhelming
nothingness of all the other atoms: each atom sending out an
infinitesimal ray of force, searching for some infinite reason, and
protesting obstinately against some infinite betrayal.

Fake. Baloney. Bunk. Apple sauce. Bull. There are over a hundred slang
synonyms for the idea which these words express, most of them coined
within the last two decades. No other idea has called forth such lavish
folk invention, and this can mean only one thing. It is the
pseudoculture’s bleak judgment upon itself. It is possible for an
inhuman society to pulverize humanity, but the human essence is
indestructible. It is meek, or it is bitter; it remains human, truthful
and essentially moral, even religious.

What is religion, if it is not the framework of instinctively felt
values of truth and beauty and honor by which the race lives—if it is to
live? Reverse these thin worn coins of the folk argot—bunk, baloney,
etc.—and you find the true currency of the human exchange. Honoring
truth, the burlesque comedian pauses in his exit, shakes his rear and
says: “Horsefeathers!”

But what we are concerned with here is not the deep human core of the
religious spirit, but the make-believe against which these atomic voices
are crying out: the fake religion, the moral, ethical and spiritual
make-believe of the acquisitive society, of the ad-man’s pseudoculture.
If the inquiry were to be in any degree systematic and exhaustive, it
would lead us far back in time, back to the medieval synthesis of church
and state and its breakup by those Knights Templar of the rising trading
class, John Calvin and Martin Luther.

There are plenty of able and informed advertising men, and some of them
know this. Yesterday I was in the research department of a large agency
gathering certain statistical data. A former associate paused, greeted
me and we fell into conversation. Knowing me, he guessed what I was
doing—in fact I had never at any time tried to conceal anything—and,
helpfully, he offered his own explanations. He blamed Martin Luther. For
the long sequence of cultural disintegration, climaxed in our time by
the paradox of mass production and mass starvation and by the
development of the advertising agency as a mass producer of f akery,
human stultification and confusion, he blamed Martin Luther.

This man started life as a traveling salesman. He never went to college,
so that his mind remained fresh and avid, if cynical. And he had known
great charlatans in his time—notably Elbert Hubbard. He understood them
very well, and, being of a speculative turn, he had checked up on their
origins. He blamed Martin Luther. He was greatly interested when I told
him that the famous German scholar, Max Weber, author of *The Protestant
Ethic*, also blamed Martin Luther a little, but John Calvin a great deal
more.

My friend had only a few minutes for gossip, however. He had to get back
to his desk and read proof on a new toothpaste campaign in which, by a
trick of pragmatic selfhypnosis, he had come to believe fervently. When
he had finished he would placidly stroll to the station, buy a paper,
and solve a cross-word puzzle en route to White Plains and his
comfortable and charming suburban family.

While somewhat exceptional, this man is far from being a unique figure
in the business. To those atomic voices heard above the clatter of
dishes in the Fourteenth Street beer gardens, we must add the voices of
the speakeasy philosophers of the Grand Central district—advertising
men, many of them, college men and more or less self-conscious fakers.
God in his blue canopy above knows they’re fakers, but it is perhaps
somewhat to their credit that they know it too.

### *2*

In discussing religion and the ad-man we are not concerned with the
sales publicity of the churches. There are plenty of texts on the
subject. What concerns us is the extent to which the culture of our
acquisitive society, as represented and publicized by the ad-man, has
become a rival of the Christian culture, represented by the Protestant
and Catholic Churches of the United States.

Since it is our purpose to compare these two cultures, it may be useful
to note what social scientists think culture and religion are. Culture
may be defined as the total social environment into which the individual
is born; religion is a behavior pattern which seeks to dominate the
culture. As sociological phenomena, religion, nationalism and
radicalism, although dissimilar in many respects, are categorically the
same. The sociologist would note the similarities between religions,
nationalism and radicalism, by calling them all behavior patterns. The
layman would call them religions. The name is not important. What is
important is the fact that they have common characteristics.

Each of these religions has an inclusive pattern for human life and
society. Each of them would prefer to be dominant and to exclude other
behavior patterns from the scene. Witness Russia and the Christian
Churches, or Nazi Germany and the Socialist and Communist Parties. As a
practical matter behavior patterns do succeed in living side by side,
but though the competition may not be overt, it is present. Every
behavior pattern has to be sold, more or less, continuously, to the
public. This is true, as the anthropologist, Malinowski, has pointed
out, even among primitive peoples. He says: “The reign of custom in a
savage society is a complex and variegated matter just as it is in a
more civilized society. Some customs are very lightly broken; others are
regarded as mandatory.” The more effective techniques used in selling
the public a behavior pattern may be considered techniques of rule.
Religious rituals belong in this category; so do the publicity engines
of Mussolini, and of Hitler. No proper perspective can be gained in
relation to such behavior patterns as religion, nationalism and
radicalism, unless one realizes that they are highly important in
relation to group survival. As Bagehot has said: “Any polity is more
efficient than none.” But the more shrewd and complete the polity, the
more efficient an instrument it is in the struggle for survival.

There are certain interesting parallelisms between the techniques of
persuasion and admonition used in religious rituals and those used in
contemporary advertising. Jane Harrison, the distinguished student of
Greek religions, notes that ritual in its beginnings has two elements:
the *dromenon*, something which is done, and the *legomenon*, something
which is said. In the beginning, the words of the ritual, according, to
Miss Harrison, may have consisted of “no more than the excited
repetition of one syllable.” The action of the ritual is something that
is “re-done, commemorative, or predone, anticipatory, and both elements
seem to go to its religiousness.” The points at which the techniques of
religious ritual and advertising correspond are the following: In both
instances, there is repetition. In both instances the symbols used in
the ritual, or the ad, have the same meaning to the audience. A symbol,
which always has the same meaning, is called by Durkheim, “a collective
representation.” A number of social scientists have pointed out that the
Utopias of the radicals become comprehensible if one realizes that they
serve as collective representations. In advertising, the name of the
product, the slogan, the packaging and the trade-mark, are obviously
used as collective representations.

The net result of religious ritual is to leave the participants in a
religious ceremony more restless than soothed, simmering gently, or
boiling violently as the case may be, in an impressionable, emotional
state, which cannot find complete release in immediate action. (Note the
ritualistic function of the movies already described as a want-building
adjunct of the advertising business.) While the audience is in this
impressionable state, the minister or priest makes strong persuasive or
admonitory suggestions in regard to the action which the individual
should take in the future. In advertising, the admonitory or persuasive
voices of the priesthood are also present.

The close analogy between the sales publicity methods of the Christian
Church and those of the modern Church of Advertising was noted in 1923
by Thorstein Veblen, who missed little, if any, of the comedy of the
American scene. Veblen’s long foot-note (p. 319, *Absentee Ownership*)
should be read in its entirety in this connection. It is particularly
interesting as showing the rapid movement of forces during the
intervening decade.

> The Propagation of the Faith is quite the largest, oldest, most
> magnificent, most unabashed, and most lucrative enterprise in
> sales-publicity in all Christendom. Much is to be learned from it as
> regards media and suitable methods of approach, as well as due
> perseverance, tact, and effrontery. By contrast, the many secular

> late and slender capitalizations out of the ample fund of human
> credulity. It is only quite recently, and even yet only with a dawning
> realization of what may be achieved by consummate effrontery in the
> long run, that these others are beginning to take on anything like the
> same air of stately benevolence and menacing solemnity. No
> pronouncement on rubber-heels, soap-powders, lip-sticks, or
> yeast-cakes, not even Sapphira Buncombe’s Vegetative Compound, are yet
> able to ignore material facts with the same magisterial detachment,
> and none has yet commanded the same unreasoning assent or acclamation.
> None other has achieved that pitch of unabated assurance which has

> do doubt; perhaps as well as might reasonably be expected under the
> circumstances, but they are a feeble thing in comparison. “Saul has
> slain his thousands,” perhaps, “but David has slain his tens of
> thousands.”

Within a year after this footnote was written, Mr. Bruce Barton
published *The Man Nobody Knows*, in which the life and works of the
Saviour are assimilated into the body of the ad-man’s doctrine, and in
which the very physical lineaments of the traditional Christ begin to
take on a family resemblance to those of the modern ad-man, so
excellently typified by Mr. Barton himself. The discussion of this
brilliant job of rationalization must be reserved for a later chapter.
At this point it is sufficient to observe that today Veblen’s ironic
patronage of the emerging priesthood of advertising sounds astonishingly
inept and dated. For it may well be contended that today the Propagation
of the Faith is relatively nowhere, while the religion of the ad-man is
everywhere dominant both as to prestige and in the matter of
administrative control. Granted that both religions are decadent, since
the underlying exploitative system which both support is itself
disintegrating by reason of its internal contradictions; none the less,
the ad-man’s religion is today the prevailing American religion, and the
true heretic must therefore concentrate upon this modern aspect of
priestcraft. The ancient Propagation of the Faith continues, of course,
sometimes in more or less collusive alliance with the Church of
Advertising, sometimes in jealous and recalcitrant opposition. We can
give little space to the quarrels and intrigues of these competing
courtiers at the High Court of Business. Clearly the present favorite is
advertising, and we turn now to a brief resume of the historic process
by which the priesthood of ballyhoo attained this high estate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *3*

Starting, as any discussion of the economic and ideological evolution of
modern industrial capitalism must start, with the breakup of the
medieval church-state synthesis, we note that the Christian feudalism of
the Middle Ages did not live by buying and selling. As John Strachey
puts it in *The Coming Struggle for Power*, “what Western man
accomplished by some four hundred years of struggle, between the
fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries, was the establishment of the
free market.” The development of monopoly capitalism in the modern
period qualified this ’ “freedom” of course; it also intensified the
fundamental contradictions of capitalism, and sharpened the ethical
dilemma which is concisely stated by the conservative philosopher, James
Hayden Tufts, in his *American Social Morality*:

> The impersonal corporation formed for profit represents in clearest
> degree this separation of the modern conduct of commerce and industry
> from all control by religious authority and by the moral standards and
> restraints grounded in the older professedly personal relations of man
> to man in kinship, neighborhood or civic community.... To turn over
> all standards to the market was to lay a foundation for future
> conflicts unless the market should provide some substitute for the
> older standards when man dealt with his fellow and faced the
> consequences of his dealing.

The market did provide such a substitute, of course—a fake substitute.
It provided the religion of advertising and developed the forms and
controls of the ad -man’s pseudoculture.

It is this utilitarian faker y with which we are here concerned, rather
than with the economic and political conquests of the trading class. We
are concerned with the ideological and religious rationalizations by
which these conquests were both implemented and justified. My former
advertising colleague who blamed this long history of serio-comic
rationalization on Martin Luther would seem to be somewhat in error,
just as Max Weber probably overemphasizes the rôle of the Protestant
Ethic, the Calvinistic doctrine of “justification by works.”

In Weber’s view the Calvinistic doctrine of worldly success in a
“calling” as a means of winning divine favor constituted a necessary
theological counterpart of capitalism; without such reinforcement of the
normal lust for gain, he argues, the extraordinary conquests of
capitalism in England and in America would have been impossible.
Calvinism reconciled piety and money-making; in fact the pursuit of
riches, which in the medieval church ethic had been feared as the enemy
of religion, was now welcomed as its ally. It is important to note, as
does Tawney in his introduction to Weber’s great essay, that the habits
and institutions in which this philosophy found expression survived long
after the creed which was their parent had practically expired. So that,
quoting Tawney, “if capitalism begins as the practical idealism of the
aspiring bourgeoisie, it ends...as an orgy of materialism.”

An orgy is an irrational affair. To the writer, the most interesting and
suggestive aspect of Weber’s interpretation, as applied to the
contemporary phenomena of the ad-man’s pseudoculture, is this divorcing
of the acquisitive drive from any control by hedonistic rationality. The
pursuit of wealth, for the Calvinistic entrepreneur, was not merely an
advantage, but a duty. And this sense of duty persisted long after the
Calvinistic sanctions had ceased to be operative. Moneymaking for
money-making’s-sake, like art-for-art’s-sake, supplied its own
sanctions. Both are self-contained disciplines, fields for the display
of an irrational and sterile virtuosity. Weber, in the concluding pages
of his essay, sets forth this consummation with moving eloquence:

> In the field of its highest development, in the United States, the
> pursuit of wealth, stripped of its religious and ethical meaning,
> tends to become associated with purely mundane passions, which often
> give the character of sport. (The advertising “game.” J. R.)
>
> No one knows who will live in this cage in the future, or whether at
> the end of this tremendous development entirely new prophets will
> arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas and ideals, or,
> if neither, mechanized petrifaction, embellished with a sort of
> convulsive self-importance. For of the last stage of this cultural
> development, it might well be truly said: “Specialists without spirit,
> sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained
> a level of civilization never before achieved.”

But note that this was written in 1905. What Weber saw with horror was
not “the last stage,” but the next-to-the-last stage—perhaps not even
that. The cage was kept spinning, not merely by its accumulated
momentum, but by the organized application, on a tremendous scale, of
the great force of emulation. Ten years before Max Weber wrote the
paragraph quoted, Thorstein Veblen had written *The Theory of the
Leisure Class*, which gave currency to his fertile concepts of
“vicarious expenditure,” “conspicuous waste,” etc. These concepts, all
revolving about the central motivation of emulation, are the
stock-in-trade of the modern advertising copy writer.

New prophets did arise in America—Elbert Hubbard for one, Bruce Barton
for another. America entered upon the “surplus economy” phase of
industrial capitalism, and the appropriate religion for this period,
which was interrupted, but also accelerated by the war, was the religion
of advertising, which did not reach full maturity until after the war.
The motion picture industry came along as an important adjunct of the
emulative promotion machinery, used as such both at home, and as an
“ideological export,” to further the conquests of American imperialism
in “backward” countries. Peering out of the vistas ahead were radio and
television.

Seeing all this, Theodore Dreiser seized upon the great theme of
emulation—keeping up with the Joneses—and wrote *The American Tragedy*.
And Carl Sandburg wrote, almost as a kind of sad ironic parody of Weber:
“This is the greatest city of the greatest country that ever, ever was.”
And the cage spun faster than ever. And Robert Frost wrote *West Running
Brook*, in which he symbolizes western culture as a stream disappearing
in the barren soil of the American acquisitive culture. And Robinson
Jeffers wrote:

> Man, introverted man, having crossed  
> In passage and but a little with the nature of things this latter  
> century
>
> Has begot giants; but being taken up  
> Like a maniac with self love and inward conflicts cannot manage his  
> hybrids.
>
> Being used to deal with edgeless dreams,  
> Now he’s bred knives on nature turns them also inward; they have  
> thirty points, though.
>
> His mind forebodes his own destruction;  
> Actæon who saw the goddess naked among the leaves and his hounds  
> tore him.
>
> A little knowledge, a pebble from the shingle,  
> A drop from the oceans; who would have dreamed this infinitely  
> little too much?

When he wrote this, as a kind of an advance obituary of industrial
capitalism, Jeifers was an unknown recluse on the coast of California,
and the book in which it appeared was printed at his own expense. But
that same year the presses rolled out the four millionth copy of Elbert
Hubbard’s *Message to Garcia*, in which the big business cracks the whip
over the modern office wage slave.

The cage spun faster still. On an August midnight in Union Square, New
York, a banner was flung out of the *Freiheit* office reading “Vanzetti
Murdered!” and, in the words of the New York *World*’s reporter:

> The crowd responded with a giant sob. Women fainted in fifteen or
> twenty places. Others too, overcome, dropped to the curbs and buried
> their heads in their hands. Men leaned on one another’s shoulders and
> wept. There was a sudden movement in the street to the east of the
> Square. Men began running around aimlessly, tearing at their clothes,
> and dropping their straw hats, and women ripped their dresses in
> anguish.

Thus the State of Massachusetts was killing the God in man. But Bruce
Barton still lived, and, having written *The Man Nobody Knows*, went on
to write *The Book Nobody Knows*, and *On the Up and Up*.
