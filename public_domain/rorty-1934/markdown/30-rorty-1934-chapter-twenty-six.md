CHAPTER 26
==========

CONCLUSION: Problems and Prospects
----------------------------------

“THERE is nothing the matter with advertising,” Bruce Barton once
protested, “that is not the matter with business in general.”

Since advertising is, in the end, merely a function of business
management, Mr. Barton’s statement is true, broadly speaking. It might
be added that there is nothing the matter with business that is not the
matter with the professions; also, that there is nothing the matter with
business *and* the professions except that they are obsolete as
practiced under the limiting conditions of an obsolete capitalist
economy. Finally, there is nothing the matter with the machine, with
industry, except that its productive forces cannot be released, and its
dehumanizing effects controlled, under a profit economy.

All these qualified acquittals must be rendered lest the edge of
criticism seems to bear too sharply and too invidiously upon the ad-man.
Invidiousness is, of course, the bread of life in a competitive
capitalist society. It is inevitable, in a fragmented civilization, that
the fragments should quarrel. It is curiously unsatisfying for a man to
be honorable and respectable in the sight of God. No, his sense of
virtue and status must be fortified by the conviction that he is *more*
honorable, more respectable than other men.

I have been greatly amused, more than once, by the complacent naïvetés
of architects, engineers, doctors, dentists, “pure” scientists, and
“objective” social scientists, who were quite prepared to agree with me
that advertising is a very dirty business. They regarded me, apparently,
as a reformed crook who was prepared, like a mission convert, to testify
concerning the satanic iniquities that I had put behind me. I have
noticed that my replies tend to chill the sympathetic interest of such
people. I say, first, that I have not wholly reformed. Since I intend to
maintain myself economically in an exploitative economy while it lasts,
I expect to enjoy the luxury of integrity in strict moderation. I say,
second, that I am not interested in pouring invidious moral and ethical
comfort into their pots by telling them how black my particular kettle
undoubtedly is.

This invidiousness, these differential judgments, came to the surface
with a rush when, in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash, the
magazine *Ballyhoo* was launched. This development, revealing as it did
the catastrophic collapse of “reader-confidence” in advertising,
deserves some detailed consideration.

Whereas the stock in trade of the ordinary mass or class consumer
magazine is reader-confidence in advertising, the stock in trade of
*Ballyhoo* was reader-disgust with advertising, and with high-pressure
salesmanship in general. Initially the magazine carried no paid
advertisements. It directed its slapstick burlesque primarily at the
absurdities of current advertising. By October, 1931, its circulation
had passed the million and a half mark and a score of imitators were
flooding the news stands.

The editor of *Ballyhoo*, Mr. Norman Anthony, was formerly one of the
editors of *Life*, and had at various times vainly urged that humorous
weekly advertising medium to bite the hand that fed it by satirizing
advertising. The stock market collapse, and the consequent reaction
against supersalesmanship of all kinds, gave Mr. Anthony his
opportunity, which he seized in realistic commercial fashion.

In style, *Ballyhoo* is a kind of monthly Bronx Cheer, bred out of *New
Yorker* by *Captain Billy’s Whizbang*. It expresses the lowest common
denominator of sterile “sophistication,” and it is still successful,
although its circulation, at last reports, had dropped to approximately
half of its 1931 peak. And for at least two years it has taken
advertising—advertising designed to sell goods, although adapted to the
pattern of *Ballyhoo*’s burlesque editorial formula.

What had apparently happened was this: the frantic excesses of the
ad-man in the production of customers by “creative psychiatry” had
created a new market in which Mr. Anthony established a pioneering
vested interest. This new market consisted of a widespread popular
demand to have advertising burlesqued. Hence *Ballyhoo* became what
might be called an enterprise in tertiary parasitism. In the present
period of capitalist decline, business, as Veblen has shown, parasites
on the creative forces of industry. Advertising, as the writer has tried
to show in this book (c.f. the chapter on “Beauty and the Ad-Man”)
parasites to a considerable degree on business. *Ballyhoo*, in turn,
parasites on the grotesque, bloated body of advertising.

Mr. Anthony’s enterprise is, of course, strictly commercial. When, after
its initial success, the owners of the magazine desired to two-time
their readers in the conventional manner of publishing-as-usual, it is
reported that Mr. Anthony at first objected. But he was over-ruled, and
in due course an advertisement appeared in *Printers’ Ink* offering
advertising space in *Ballyhoo*.

Without serious injustice the sales talk of *Ballyhoo*’s advertising
manager may be paraphrased as follows:

“Advertisers: Buy space in *Ballyhoo*. Of course we burlesque you and
shall continue to do so, whether you buy space in the magazine or not.
But these burlesques don’t hurt your business. They help it. True, the
saps laugh, but they also buy. Think of it! A mob of a million and a
half saps, laughing and buying! Here they are, packaged and ready to
deliver. How much do you offer?”

After this, the hostility with which many advertisers and many
advertising-supported publications had regarded *Ballyhoo* began to
subside. What if Mr. Anthony’s publication was, in a sense, a parasitic
enterprise? He was smart. *Ballyhoo* had got away with it. And forthwith
they proceeded to imitate him.

More and more, advertising began to step out of its part and kid itself.
The single column, cartoon-illustrated campaign for Sir Walter Raleigh
Smoking Tobacco is an early example of this trend. The early copy,
particularly, was an obvious burlesque of the Listerine halitosis-shame
copy. Other advertisers picked up the idea, especially radio
advertisers. Ed Wynn’s kidding of Fire Chief gasoline is an excellent
example of the application of burlesque to the production of customers.
More and more, it is the fashion to make radio sales talk allegedly more
palatable by infecting the whole program with burlesque advertising
asides.

Even the preview advertising in the motion picture theatresis beginning
to betray a similar infection. For example, thepreview promotion of
*George White’s Scandals* consisted ofa genuinely amusing satire of the
hackneyed extravagancesof motion picture advertising. The Jewish
comedian whoplayed the rôle of assistant impresario was sternly
forbiddenby Mr. White to use the words “stupendous,” “gigantic”
and“colossal” in describing the wonders of the new show. Drivento
desperation by this cruel stifling of commercial enthu-siasm, the
comedian threatened to shoot himself, and did so.His dying words are:
“George White’s Scandals is a stupen-dous, gigantic, and colossal show.”

It is contended by the broadcasters, and doubtless also by the movie
producers, that this burlesque sales promotion takes the curse out of
sales talk, and this is probably true to a degree. But the prevalence of
the trend gives rise to certain ominous suspicions. In every decadent
period, satire and burlesque tend to become the dominant artistic forms.
When the burlesque comedian mounts the pulpit in the Church of
Advertising, it may be legitimately suspected that the edifice is
doomed; that it will shortly be torn down or converted to secular uses.

Confirmation of this suspicion appears in the current rôle of the
advertising trade press, indeed of the trade press in general. The
writer has had occasion to note that his contributions on the subject of
advertising were not welcomed by consumer publications supported by
advertising. In contrast, the trade press has given space to forthright
radical attacks upon the advertising business both by the writer and by
other critics of advertising such as Dr. Robert Lynd, F. J. Schlink and
others.

This is less surprising than it might seem at first sight. Both
*Advertising and Selling* and *Printers’ Ink* have at first times built
their circulations by crusading for “truth in advertising,” the
prohibition of bought-and-paid-for testimonials, and other items of
pragmatic advertising morality. Moreover, their readers want to know
what the dastardly enemies of advertising are doing and thinking, and
who is in a better position to tell them than these very miscreants
themselves?

This brings us to a consideration of the agitation for government
grading of staple products, which is the chief threat by which the
advertising business is now menaced. It met and defeated this threat by
deleting the standards clause from the original Tugwell Bill. But the
same threat popped up at every code hearing and in Dr. Lynd’s report
urging the establishment of a Consumers’ Standards Board, which was
followed by F. J. Schlink’s more sweeping demand for a Department of the
Consumer with representation in the Cabinet.

To defeat the raid of the New Deal reformers on the advertising
business, the food, drug, cosmetics and advertising interests
concentrated in Washington a lobby reliably estimated to be from three
to four times as big as any other Washington lobby in history. Yet in
spite of this huge effort the Copeland Bill, after successive revisions
by the Senate Commerce committee, emerged with a number of its smaller
teeth still intact, and conceivably it may be passed by the time this
book appears.

An ironic aspect of the matter was the dual rôle played by Senator
Copeland, as broadcaster for Fleischmann’s Yeast and Nujol, and as
sponsor of a bill which would, if passed, have definitely limited the
advertising activities of his commercial employers. On March 31st,
Arthur Kallet, Secretary of Consumers’ Research, who, with F. J.
Schlink, had ably and energetically defended the consumer interest in
Washington in connection with the Tugwell and Copeland Bills, the
censorship and suppression of the Consumers’ Advisory Board, etc.,
signed a circular letter urging the defeat of the emasculated Copeland
Bill and the mobilizing of consumer support of the Consumers’ Research
Bill (H.R. 8313). Enclosed was the following statement by the Emergency
Conference of Consumer Organizations.

> “The Fleischmann Yeast Company, probably to an extent greater than
> almost any other national advertiser, would be affected adversely by
> the original Tugwell Food and Drug Bill. This bill has been twice
> revised by Senator Royal S. Copeland, who is employed by the
> Fleischmann Yeast Company at a high fee in connection with its weekly
> advertising broadcast.
>
> “The original Tugwell Bill was far too weak to afford adequate
> consumer protection, and the Copeland-revised Bill is so much weaker
> from the consumer viewpoint that it should be thrown out entirely and
> new legislation substituted. This cannot be accomplished unless it is
> driven home to the public that there is probably only one man in
> Congress who is and has been employed by manufacturers of dubious drug
> products, and that this person has, for some curious reason, been
> placed in charge of food and drug regulatory legislation. The twice
> revised bill shows that Dr. Copeland has taken excellent advantage of
> the opportunity thus afforded him to emasculate the original bill.
>
> “The Tugwell Bill was introduced by Dr. Copeland at the last session
> of Congress. It was turned over to a sub-committee of the Senate
> Interstate Commerce Committee (where consumer-protective legislation
> certainly does not belong). The sub-committee consisted of Senator
> Copeland as chairman, Senator McNary (a fruit grower who would also be
> adversely affected by the bill) and Senator Hat tie Caraway. This
> sub-committee held public hearings early in December. During the
> two-day hearings, Senators Copeland and McNary’s antagonism to the
> best features of the bill was manifest. Moreover, while
> representatives of the manufacturers whose fraudulent and dangerous
> activities were to be controlled were given every opportunity to
> attack the proposed bill, not a single consumer was given a hearing
> until within two hours of the close of the session. Senator Copeland’s
> commercial connections were pointed out by representatives of
> Consumers’ Research, and new hearings under an impartial chairman were
> demanded, but this demand was ignored. It is noteworthy that at the
> end of the first day’s session, Dr. Copeland went from the hearings to
> a broadcasting studio to speak on behalf of Fleischmann’s Yeast.
>
> “The Senator is now and has in the past been employed by other
> advertisers who would be adversely affected by the Tugwell Bill, among
> them the Sterling Products Company, and the makers of Nujol.
>
> “The broadcasts for Fleischmann’s Yeast were begun after the Senator
> introduced the Tugwell Bill. For a Senator to accept compensation from
> an organization affected by pending legislation is a violation of a
> criminal law, if there is any intent to affect the legislation. While
> intent cannot in this case be proved, there is clearly a violation of
> the spirit of the law.”

Supplementing this statement, it may be noted that a business
organization known as the Copeland Service, Inc., occupies the office at
250 W. 57th Street adjoining the office of Senator Copeland. The
president of this organization is Mr. Ole Salthe, who in an interview
with the writer on April 5th undertook to describe the nature of this
business. A brief advertising folder issued by Copeland Service, Inc.,
offers the following services:

> #### *Laboratory Service*
>
> Including chemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinical and
> biological tests, particularly in relation to the improvement of
> present products or the development of new products.

> #### *Radio Programs and Lectures*
>
> Dr. Royal S. Copeland and a staff of experienced radio speakers are
> available to manufacturers of meritorious food and drug products.
> These speakers can talk authoritatively on health, food, diet and
> nutrition, and insure broadcasts that are interesting and productive
> of sales.

> #### *Labels and Printed Matter*
>
> Wide experience in the revision and preparation of labels and printed
> matter concerning claims made for food and drug products so as to
> conform to municipal, State and Federal Laws.

> #### *Special Articles*
>
> Relating to health, food, diet and nutrition written in a popular
> style for general distribution.

> #### *Market and Field Surveys*
>
> Staff of experienced investigators in the food and drug industries are
> available.

Dr. Salthe was for twenty years in the employ of the New York City
Department of Health, being director of the diyision of foods and drugs
when he retired in 1924. In 1925 he became president of Copeland
Service, Inc., with which Royal S. Copeland Jr. is also now connected.
Dr. Salthe declared that aside from broadcasting services for
Fleischmann’s Yeast and Stance, makers of Nujol and Cream of Nujol,
Copeland Service, Inc., had no clients. Did I know of any prospects? Dr.
Sal the earnestly denied any connection whatever between the Senator’s
sponsorship of the food and drug bill and his rôle as a radio artist for
Yeast and Nujol. Copeland Service, Inc., he said, was trying to put on a
sustaining program over N.B.C. stations in which the Senator would give
“constructive educational talks on food buying, including the mentioning
of worthy products.”

Consumers of foods, drugs and cosmetics are invited to decide what is
wrong with this picture and to extract whatever wry amusement they can
from it.

Obviously, neither the emasculated Copeland Bill, nor the original
Tugwell Bill, nor even the Consumers’ Research Bill represent a direct
functional approach to the economic and social problems involved,
because no such approach is possible within the framework of the
capitalist economy. All that is possible is to set up more and more
rigid legal and administrative controls over the exploitative activities
of business. The Consumers’ Research Bill goes the limit in this
direction. Under its provisions manufacturers of drugs and cosmetics,
and of food products potentially dangerous to health, would be licensed
and bonded; only approved products could be manufactured; all labels and
advertising claims would have to be approved by a board of experts.

The bill is well calculated to freeze the blood of the admen, drug men,
vitamin men and cosmeticians. Incidentally, it constitutes an *excellent
reductio ad absurdum* of the whole idea of progress by reform,
capitalist planning, etc. Obviously, it would be much simpler to
socialize pharmacy, medicine and the production and distribution of
foods, and, also obviously, no such socialization could be achieved
without a social revolution.

The most serious challenge to advertisers, and to the advertising
business is, of course, embodied in the agitation for government grading
conducted by the Consumers’ Advisory Board, the Consumers’ Counsel of
the AAA, and from the outside by Consumers’ Research. Here, too, the
maximum result to be attained within the framework of the capitalist
economy would still leave untouched the major contradictions of
capitalism. The agitation is none the less important and fruitful. The
demand for government grading of consumers’ goods cannot be successfully
argued against, even from the premises of competitive capitalism. The
promulgation of quality standards and their control would be necessary
government functions in any economy. Significantly, the agitation for
standards has brought to light serious cleavages between the vested
interests affected.

Between the manufacturers and the consumer stand the big distributors,
the mail order houses, the department stores, and the chain stores. They
tend increasingly to sell house products rather than advertised brands.
They represent the more nearly efficient and functional agencies of
distribution under capitalism. They are powerful, and they object to
being squeezed by manufacturers, either through high prices or lowered
standards.

In the course of General Johnson’s field day for critics last March,
Irving C. Fox, secretary of the National Retail Dry Goods Association,
in addition to protesting against price rises, revealed that within a
week or two after the codes went into effect, with provisions
prohibiting returns after five days, the quality of merchandise became
much lower than prior to the adoption of these provisions. Chain store,
mail order and department store buyers, and buyers for municipal, State
and Federal departments, have been, in all probability, the most
effective allies of the Consumers’ Advisory Board in the fight against
high prices and lowered standards. Not that the consumer standards
movement has got anywhere to date. In one of the reports of the
Consumers’ Advisory Board, Prof. Robert Brady testified that

> “Of the first 220 codes, which cover the most important American
> industries, only about 70 contain clauses having anything to do with
> standards, grading or labeling. Most of these clauses are absolutely
> worthless from the point of view of the consuming interests. In some
> cases they are so vague that they permit anything and condone
> everything. In some cases they are positively vicious in that they may
> be used covertly for price fixing purposes and even practically to
> compel the lowering of quality. In four cases, for example, the code
> authority is instructed to declare that the giving of guarantees
> beyond a certain point is an unfair trade practice,, whereas most of
> the industries affected have long been accustomed to give and live up
> to guaranties far beyond these points.”

For confirmation of this statement we have only to turn to the *Journal
of Commerce* for April 13, 1934, from which the following quotation is
taken:

> “Substitution of lower quality for standard products continues on a
> substantial scale and prevents consumers from realizing the full
> import of price increases that have taken place.
>
> “Retail prices in many lines have been arrived at after study and
> experience with mass buying habits. Merchants conclude, therefore,
> that they must preserve these established price levels even at the
> cost of sacrificing quality, to maintain their physical volume of
> sales.
>
> “This reasoning has been found so practical and effective in many
> instances that manufacturers of branded and trade-marked merchandise
> have been adopting the same policy in increasing numbers, it is
> reported. In some cases, manufacture of the previous standard quality
> is being given up altogether. In some other instances goods meeting
> the old specifications are being sold under a new branded name at a
> higher price.”

### *2.*

In the light of all these developments, the advertising profession is
bound to contemplate its future with alarm and foreboding. Where
business in general fears the still remote prospect of social
revolution, the advertising business faces deflation through the
inevitable and already well-begun processes of industrial cartelization,
of capitalist “rationalization,” which here, as in Italy, Germany, and
in England are bound to enforce a lower standard of living upon the
masses of the population.

At the last convention of the Association of National Advertisers, Dr.
Walter B. Pitkin, Professor of the School of Journalism at Columbia
University, played Cassandra to the assembled ad-men by adding up the
costs of the depression to advertising. “To begin with,” said Dr.
Pitkin, “we are left with between 60 and 64 million people at or below
the subsistence level.” These are “extra-economic men” as far as the
advertising business is concerned. The arts of “creative psychiatry” are
wasted on them because their buying power is negligible. The average
annual per capita income is down to $276. If from this is subtracted an
average of $77 for fixed debt charges, we are left with an average of
per capita expendible income of $199. Multiply this by four and we have
$800 as the family average.

But Dr. Pitkin had worse horrors than this to reveal. He believes that
even if we have recovery sufficient to bring about a return of the
pre-depression income levels, this recovery will not be accompanied by
similar spending. Not only are there between 60 and 64 million
“extra-economic Americans—outside the money and profit system,” but they
don’t want to get back into this system. Dr. Pitkin cited examples of
middle class professional people, who, having become adapted to the
shock of having to live on eighteen dollars a week, were content with
what they had; at least they were unashamed, since so many of their
friends were in a similar condition. Dr. Pitkin sums up the problem
confronting the advertising profession as follows:

> “You have got not merely the problem of scheming to get people’s
> income up, but you have got the problem of breaking down what you
> might call a degenerate type of social prestige, and that is a new
> problem in advertising and selling, it is a new problem in
> merchandising which not one manufacturer in the United States has yet
> attempted to face.”

In passing it might be noted that as a result of the “scheming to get
people’s income up” as conducted by the industrialists who wrote the
codes, some of whom were in Dr. Pitkin’s audience, the volume of goods
sold in February, 1934, was apparently from 6 to 8 per cent less than in
February, 1933.

The assembled advertising men fired questions at Dr. Pitkin. They begged
this earnest savant for some hope, for some way of “meeting the issue.”
This is what they got:

> “We have seen advertising in the last twenty-five years develop from
> local commodity advertising, next to trade advertising, then
> institutional advertising of a whole domain of businesses....Those are
> merely the first movements in a direction toward which we must go a
> long way further. You have got to go beyond institutional advertising
> to some new kind of philosophy of life advertising. I don’t know any
> better expression for it than that, but what I mean is that you have
> got to sell an enormous number of people in the United States, people
> of power, people of intelligence as well as the down-and-outs; you
> have got to sell them the conception very clearly of the American
> standard of living as we used to think of it, and have a return to it
> with all that it implies.”

If this seems fantastic under the circumstances, I can only point out
that among advertising men in general, Dr. Pitkin is regarded as a
top-leader intellectual. The ad-men were made pretty unhappy on this
occasion, for they couldn’t see how they were going to carry out Dr.
Pitkin’s recommendations. In effect, what he said was: “What you need is
more advertising.” And they knew that before.

Advertising men are indeed very unhappy these days, very nervous, with a
kind of apocalyptic expectancy. Often when I have lunched with an agency
friend, a half dozen worried copy writers and art directors have
accompanied us. Invariably they want to know when the revolution is
coming, and where will *they* get off if it does come.

The other day I encountered a very eminent advertising man indeed,
emerging from an ex-speakeasy. He hailed me jovially and put the usual
question: “How’s the revolution coming?”

“Rather badly,” I replied. “Although I think you and your crowd are
certainly doing your bit.”

“You’re damned right,” replied this advertising magnifico. “I’ve got a
big white horse. I call him ‘Comrade.’ And when the revolution comes,
I’ll be right out in front: ‘Comrade Blotz’.”

With a sudden chill I reflected that, given the sort of mass moronism
which the advertising business has been manufacturing for these many
years, something of the sort might conceivably happen. What that eminent
ad-man thought of as “revolution” was, of course, Fascism. I venture to
predict that when a formidable Fascist movement develops in America, the
ad-men will be right up in front; that the American versions of Minister
of Propaganda and Enlightenment Goebels (the man whom wry-lipped Germans
have Christened “Wotan’s Mickey Mouse”) will be both numerous and
powerful.
