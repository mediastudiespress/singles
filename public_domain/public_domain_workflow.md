# Workflow for Public Domain Works

1. Create a watermark according to this template:

> Excerpts from Chapter XII ("The Self") appear as William James. "The Self (1892)." In *Social Media & the Self: An Open Access Reader* 1.0, edited by Jefferson Pooley. Bethlehem, PA: mediastudies.press, 2019. https://doi.org/10.21428/3f8575cb.2a4b8bf4

>Credit for scan: Internet Archive, contributor: Emmanuel - University of Toronto, 2006 upload, https://archive.org/details/psychologybriefe00willuoft

>This watermark and the highlights can be removed using standard PDF tools.

2. Take a screenshot of cover, if a full book, and add to the Front Matter

* Title the jpg lastname-year-title-page.jpg

3. Every excerpt, add something like this: Excerpt from James Rorty. Our Master’s Voice: Advertising. New York: John Day Company, 1934: v–viii.

4. Save each excerpt into Github folder

5. Create a header/preview 1200px to 800px for each chapter: rorty-1200-800
