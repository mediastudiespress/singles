are inserted into the eomprehenslv© and* as "if were * .official 
social formations® they alone produce society as we know it© To 
eonf Iheour s elves to the large social formations resembles the 
older science of anatomy with its limitation to the major® defi- 
nitely eirctmscri ted organs such as heart, liver* lungs., z and ^ 
stomach* and with its neglect qf the innumerable, popularly un- 
named or unlsiown tissues© Yet without these, the more, obvious- 
organs could never constitute a living organism® On the basis of 
the major social formations —the traditional subject matter of 
social science — it would be similarly impossible to piece together 
the real life of society as we encounter It in our experience® 
Without the interspersed effects of countless minor syntheses.*- so- 
ciety would break up^into a multitude of discontinuous systems®, 
Soeiation continuously emerges and ceases and emerges again® Even 
where its eternal flux and pulsation are not sufficiently strong 
to form organizations proper 9 they link individuals together® 

That people look at on© another* and are Jealous of one another; 
that they exchange letters or dine together; that irrespective of 
all tangible interests they strike one another as pleasant or un- 
pleasant; that gratitude for altruistic acts makes for inseparable 
union; that . one asks another man after a certain street , and that 
people dress and adorn themselves for one another— the whole gamut 
of relations that play from on© person to another and that, may' be 
momentary or permanent , conscious or . unccns clous , ephmeral or of 
grave consequence (and from which these illustrations are quite 
casually ’ chbs.en}* all these incessantly tie in£n together® Here

This study is mainly concerned with events which occur ree 

la the social life of commoners that are native to Dixon® The 






versatloxx&l interaction between concrete persons who are In each 
other's immediate presence is a species of soei&l order and can 
be studied by applying thp model of social order to it. The ap- 
plicability of this model to conversational interaction Is sug- 
gested below® In this arid in other chapters dealing with the con 
ceptual framework f conversation in Western society is assumed as 
the data for which the framework is to be relevant* 



The Model 

1. Social order is found where the differentiated aetivi 
ty of different actors is Integrated into a single whole® al- 
lowing thereby for t^ie conscious or unconscious realization 
of certain overall ends or functions®

pant is sufficiently meaningful and acceptable to the other par- 
ticipants tcK constitute a starting point for the next message,, 



tion for other actors; they are able to know beforehand with- 
in what limits ,th£ actor is likely to behave * and they have a 
moral right to expect him to behave within these limits® 
Correspondingly » he ought to behave in the way that is ex- 
pected of him because he feels that this is a morally desira- 
ble way of behaviiig and not merely an expeditious way of be« 
having # 

This criterion of social order can he applied without modifica- 
tion or elaboration tlo the case .of conversational Interaction® 



3# Proper contribution from participants is assured or 
"motivated " by mejsans of a set of positive sanctions or re- 
wards and negative sanctions or punishments, These sanctions 
grant or withdraw immediately expressed social approval and 
goods of a more instrumental kind. These sanctions support 
and help to delineate social rules that are both'^prescrlptive 
and proscriptive j, enjoining certain activity and forbidding 
other activity® 

The relation between conversational order and the sanctions that 



regulate It seems somewhat different from the relation between 



other types of sociajl order and the sanctions which regulate them

the model. For example* the exercise of gain strategies is so 
common a thing that jit is often better to conceive of interaction 
not. as a scene of harmony hut as an arrangement for persuing a 
cold war * A working acceptance may thus be likened to a tempo- 
rary truce, a modus vlvendl for carrying on negotiations and vital 

business. 

It is interesting to note that a desire to maintain a 
working acceptance , paradoxically enough, one of the few gen- 
eral bases of real consensus between persons « Individuals regu- 
larly act on the assumption that others are the sort of persons 
who would attempt tjo maintain a working acceptance, and this im-

is possible for m.m to modify his message and within his 
capacity to do ITo®^ 

A linguistic message- -more technically » the semantic 
component of a message — has an explicitly stated object 
cof reference or direction of intent. ^As a recent student 
of conversational interaction has suggested? 

«The direction of intent is operationally defined as 
the object toward which the remark is made* Remarks 
may be directed toward the self, toward the group re- 
lationships, toward the issue being discussed and toward 
aspects not 'involved in the immediate grouping #* J - 

The "steering ' 1 of a message resides, then, In what is said 
about its object of reference* Meaning is thus officially 
independent of the actor who sends the sassgfje and of the 
conditions under which the message is sent , 6 

No- doubt the most important kinds of linguistic behavior 



consist of spoken ana writer, c oramunic at i 



There are, of course

of other kinds* 'The horse code ana the semaphore system provide
